## Module 1: Introduction to IFRS

### What is IFRS?

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a set of accounting rules for the financial statements of public companies that are intended to make them consistent, transparent, and easily comparable around the world. IFRS is issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The goal of IFRS is to provide a global framework for how public companies prepare and disclose their financial statements. IFRS aims to improve the comparability and quality of financial information, enabling investors and other stakeholders to make informed economic decisions.

### Why is IFRS important?

IFRS is important because it provides a common language for financial reporting, making it easier for investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to compare companies across different countries. This comparability is crucial in a globalized economy where businesses operate across borders and investors seek opportunities worldwide. By adhering to IFRS, companies can enhance their credibility and transparency, which can lead to increased investor confidence and access to international capital markets. Furthermore, IFRS helps to ensure that financial statements are reliable and reflect the true economic substance of transactions, which is essential for maintaining market stability and investor trust. The adoption of IFRS also simplifies the consolidation process for multinational corporations, as it provides a unified accounting framework across all their operations.

### History of IFRS

The history of IFRS dates back to the late 1960s when the need for a common set of international accounting standards became apparent due to increasing cross-border trade and investment. The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was established in 1973 with the goal of developing a single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable, and globally accepted accounting standards. In 2001, the IASC was restructured and became the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which now oversees the development and promulgation of IFRS. Since then, IFRS has gained widespread acceptance, with many countries adopting or requiring IFRS for their publicly traded companies. The European Union, for example, mandated the use of IFRS for all listed companies starting in 2005. Today, over 140 jurisdictions require or permit the use of IFRS, making it a truly global standard for financial reporting.
