## IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements

**Objective:** IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements sets out overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements, guidelines for their structure, and minimum requirements for their content. The objective is to ensure comparability both with the entity's financial statements of previous periods and with the financial statements of other entities.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Fair Presentation and Compliance with IFRS:** Financial statements must present fairly the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events, and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses set out in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. Application of IFRS, with additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation.
2.  **Going Concern:** When preparing financial statements, management shall make an assessment of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. Financial statements shall be prepared on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
3.  **Accrual Basis of Accounting:** An entity shall prepare its financial statements, except for cash flow information, using the accrual basis of accounting.
4.  **Materiality and Aggregation:** Each material class of similar items shall be presented separately in the financial statements. Items of a dissimilar nature or function shall be presented separately unless they are immaterial.
5.  **Offsetting:** Assets and liabilities, and income and expenses, shall not be offset unless required or permitted by an IFRS.
6.  **Frequency of Reporting:** An entity shall present a complete set of financial statements (including comparative information) at least annually. When an entity changes the end of its reporting period and presents financial statements for a period longer or shorter than one year, an entity shall disclose, in addition to the period covered by the financial statements, the reason for using a longer or shorter period, and the fact that comparative amounts for certain statements such as the statement of cash flows are not entirely comparable.
7.  **Comparative Information:** Comparative information shall be disclosed in respect of the previous period for all amounts reported in the current period’s financial statements. Comparative information shall also be included for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to an understanding of the current period’s financial statements.
8.  **Consistency of Presentation:** The presentation and classification of items in the financial statements shall be retained from one period to the next unless a change is justified either by a change in circumstances or a requirement of a new IFRS.

**Structure of Financial Statements:**

*   **Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet):** Provides a snapshot of an entity's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.
*   **Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income:** Reports an entity's financial performance over a period of time. It includes all items of income and expense recognised in a period. Other comprehensive income (OCI) includes items of income and expense (including reclassification adjustments) that are not recognised in profit or loss as required or permitted by other IFRSs.
*   **Statement of Changes in Equity:** Shows the changes in an entity’s equity during a period. It includes profit or loss, other comprehensive income, and transactions with owners in their capacity as owners (e.g., contributions of equity, distributions to owners).
*   **Statement of Cash Flows:** Provides information about the changes in cash and cash equivalents of an entity during a period. It classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities.
*   **Notes to the Financial Statements:** Provide additional information relevant to an understanding of the financial statements. This includes information about the basis of preparation of the financial statements and specific accounting policies used; disclosures required by IFRSs that are not presented elsewhere in the financial statements; and additional information that is relevant to an understanding of any of the items shown in the primary financial statements.

**Key Disclosures:**

*   **General Information:** Name of the reporting entity, whether the financial statements cover the individual entity or a group of entities, the date of the end of the reporting period or the period covered by the set of financial statements or notes, the presentation currency, and the level of rounding used.
*   **Accounting Policies:** Significant accounting policies applied.
*   **Supporting Information:** Supporting information for items presented on the face of the financial statements.
*   **Other Disclosures:** Contingent liabilities and unrecognised contractual commitments, non-financial disclosures (e.g., the entity’s financial risk management objectives and policies).

Understanding IAS 1 is fundamental as it lays the groundwork for how financial information is presented and interpreted, ensuring transparency and comparability across different entities and periods.
