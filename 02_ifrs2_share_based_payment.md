## IFRS 2: Share-based Payment

**Objective:** The primary objective of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment is to ensure that entities recognise share-based payment transactions in their financial statements, including transactions with employees or other parties settled in cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity. This means that the financial statements should reflect the economic substance of these transactions, which is that the entity has consumed economic benefits (in the form of goods or services received) for which it has issued equity instruments or incurred a liability.

**Scope:** IFRS 2 applies to all share-based payment transactions, regardless of whether the entity can identify specifically all the goods or services received. Share-based payment transactions include equity-settled transactions, cash-settled transactions, and transactions where either the entity or the supplier has a choice of settlement in cash (or other assets) or equity instruments. This standard encompasses a wide range of arrangements, such as share option plans for employees, share appreciation rights, and share purchase plans. It also applies to share-based payment transactions in which an entity acquires goods as part of the net assets acquired in a business combination, and to transactions with employees (or others) in their capacity as employees (or in a similar capacity). However, it does not apply to transactions with employees (and others) in their capacity as holders of equity instruments of the entity.

**Key Principles:**

IFRS 2 is founded on the principle that an entity should recognise an expense when it consumes goods or services. When these goods or services are received as consideration for equity instruments, the corresponding entry is an increase in equity. If the goods or services are received as consideration for a liability to pay cash (or other assets) in amounts based on the price of the entity's shares or other equity instruments, the corresponding entry is an increase in liabilities.

*   **Recognition:** An entity must recognise the goods or services received or acquired in a share-based payment transaction when it obtains the goods or as the services are received. If the share-based payments vest immediately, the entity presumes that services rendered by the counterparty as consideration for the share-based payments have been received. In this case, on grant date the entity recognises the services received in full with a corresponding increase in equity or liabilities. If the share-based payments do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of service, the entity presumes that the services to be rendered by the counterparty as consideration for those share-based payments will be received in the future, during the vesting period. The entity accounts for those services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity or liabilities.

*   **Measurement - Equity-settled Share-based Payment Transactions:** For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the entity measures the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, directly at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received (which is typically the case for transactions with employees), the entity must measure their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. The fair value of the equity instruments is measured at the grant date. For transactions with parties other than employees, there is a rebuttable presumption that the fair value of the goods or services received can be estimated reliably.

*   **Measurement - Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions:** For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the entity measures the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the entity must remeasure the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period. The fair value of the liability is based on the price of the entity’s shares or other equity instruments.

*   **Vesting Conditions:** Vesting conditions determine whether the entity receives the services that entitle the counterparty to receive cash, other assets or equity instruments of the entity under a share-based payment arrangement. Vesting conditions are either service conditions or performance conditions. A service condition requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service. A performance condition requires the counterparty to complete a specified period of service and specified performance targets to be met (such as a specified increase in the entity’s profit over a specified period of time). Performance conditions can be market conditions (e.g., attaining a specified share price or a specified amount of intrinsic value of a share option) or non-market conditions (e.g., achieving a sales target or remaining in employment for a specified period). The accounting for vesting conditions depends on whether they are market or non-market conditions. Market conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Non-market vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the measurement date. Instead, non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.

**Practical Example Scenario:**

Let's consider Innovate Corp, a technology company that grants 1,000 share options to each of its 50 senior engineers on January 1, 20X1. The options have a grant-date fair value of $20 per option. The options vest if the engineers remain in service for three years (a service condition). Additionally, the options will only vest if the company achieves a cumulative revenue growth of 30% over the three-year period (a non-market performance condition). Innovate Corp expects all engineers to remain for three years and for the revenue target to be met.

In this scenario, Innovate Corp would calculate the total fair value of the options granted as 50 engineers * 1,000 options/engineer * $20/option = $1,000,000. This amount would be recognised as an expense over the three-year vesting period. Each year, an expense of $333,333 ($1,000,000 / 3 years) would be recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity (share-based payment reserve).

If, during the vesting period, it becomes apparent that the revenue growth target (the non-market performance condition) is unlikely to be met, Innovate Corp would adjust the cumulative expense recognised. For example, if at the end of Year 2, it is deemed not probable that the revenue target will be achieved, no further expense would be recognised, and any expense previously recognised would be reversed (unless the options vested due to other conditions). Conversely, if the number of employees expected to meet the service condition changes, the expense is adjusted prospectively.

If the options also had a market condition, such as the company's share price reaching $100 within three years, this market condition would have been factored into the grant-date fair value of $20 per option. The expense recognition would proceed based on this fair value, irrespective of whether the share price target is actually met, as long as the service and non-market performance conditions are satisfied.

**Key Takeaways for IFRS 2:**

IFRS 2 is a complex standard that requires careful consideration of the terms and conditions of share-based payment arrangements. It mandates the recognition of an expense for such transactions, reflecting the consumption of resources. The measurement of this expense depends on whether the transaction is equity-settled or cash-settled, and involves determining the fair value of the equity instruments granted or the liability incurred. Vesting conditions, particularly the distinction between market and non-market conditions, play a crucial role in determining the timing and amount of expense recognition. Proper application of IFRS 2 enhances the transparency and comparability of financial statements by ensuring that the costs associated with share-based compensation are appropriately accounted for.
