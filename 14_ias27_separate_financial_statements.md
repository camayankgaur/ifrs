## IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements is to prescribe the accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when an entity prepares separate financial statements. Separate financial statements are those presented by a parent (ie an investor with control of a subsidiary) or an investor with joint control of, or significant influence over, an investee, in which the investments are accounted for at cost or in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The Standard does not mandate which entities produce separate financial statements, but when they are prepared, IAS 27 applies.

**Scope:** IAS 27 applies when an entity prepares separate financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. It does not apply to the condensed interim financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements are not affected by this Standard for the purposes of consolidated financial statements, financial statements in which investments in associates or joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, or financial statements in which venturers or investors account for their interests in joint ventures or associates using proportionate consolidation or the equity method.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Separate financial statements:** Those presented by an entity in which the entity could elect, subject to the requirements in this Standard, to account for its investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates either at cost, in accordanceance with IFRS 9, or using the equity method as described in IAS 28.
*   **Consolidated financial statements:** The financial statements of a group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity.
*   The definitions of control, joint control, significant influence, subsidiary, joint venture, associate, and parent are consistent with those in IFRS 10, IFRS 11, and IAS 28.

**Key Principles - Preparation of Separate Financial Statements:**

When an entity prepares separate financial statements, it shall account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates either:

1.  **At cost:** The investment is initially recognised at cost. The investor recognises income from the investment only to the extent that the investor receives distributions from post-acquisition accumulated profits of the investee. Distributions received in excess of such profits are regarded as a recovery of investment and are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment.
2.  **In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments:** This means the investments would be classified and measured according to the requirements of IFRS 9, which could involve measurement at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or amortised cost (though amortised cost is unlikely for equity investments unless they are debt-like preference shares).
3.  **Using the equity method as described in IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures:** Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income.

The entity shall apply the same accounting for each category of investments. Investments accounted for at cost or using the equity method shall be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations when they are classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale).

**Dividends:** When a parent, an investor with joint control of, or significant influence over, an investee prepares separate financial statements, it recognises dividends from a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate in profit or loss in its separate financial statements when its right to receive the dividend is established. This is regardless of whether the dividends are paid out of pre-acquisition or post-acquisition profits of the investee, if the investment is accounted for at cost or in accordance with IFRS 9. If the equity method is used, dividends received from an investee are recognised as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment.

**Disclosure:** In its separate financial statements, an entity shall disclose:
*   The fact that the statements are separate financial statements and the reason why these statements are prepared if not required by law.
*   A list of significant investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, including: (i) the name of those investees; (ii) the principal place of business (and country of incorporation, if different) of those investees; (iii) the proportion of ownership interest (and proportion of voting power held, if different) held in those investees.
*   A description of the method used to account for the investments listed under the previous point.
*   When an entity accounts for its investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates at cost or using the equity method, it must also make disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement for those investments accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9.
*   If a parent, in accordance with IFRS 10, elects not to prepare consolidated financial statements and instead uses the exemption, it must disclose that fact and the basis on which the separate financial statements have been prepared, and why the exemption was used. It must also disclose summarised financial information about the group.

**Practical Example Scenario (Investment in Subsidiary at Cost):**

Parent P acquired 100% of Subsidiary S for $500,000 on January 1, 20X1. Parent P prepares separate financial statements and chooses to account for its investment in S at cost.

*   **Initial Recognition in P’s separate financial statements:** Investment in Subsidiary S (Asset) $500,000.
*   During 20X1, Subsidiary S earns a profit of $80,000 and declares and pays a dividend of $30,000 to Parent P.
*   **Dividend Recognition in P’s separate financial statements:** Parent P recognises dividend income of $30,000 in its profit or loss. The carrying amount of the investment in S remains $500,000 (unless impaired).
*   If, at December 31, 20X1, there is an indication that the investment in S is impaired (e.g., S has been making significant losses, or its fair value less costs to sell is below $500,000), Parent P would test the investment for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

**Practical Example Scenario (Investment in Associate using Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements):**

Investor A acquires a 30% interest in Associate B for $100,000, giving it significant influence. Investor A prepares separate financial statements and elects to use the equity method for its investment in associates.

*   **Initial Recognition:** Investment in Associate B $100,000.
*   In the first year, Associate B reports a profit of $50,000 and pays no dividends.
*   **Investor A’s share of profit:** $50,000 * 30% = $15,000.
*   **Carrying amount of investment at year-end:** $100,000 (cost) + $15,000 (share of profit) = $115,000. Investor A recognises $15,000 in its profit or loss as its share of Associate B’s profit.
*   If Associate B had instead paid a dividend of $10,000 (Investor A’s share being $3,000), Investor A would recognise the $3,000 dividend as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The carrying amount would be $100,000 + $15,000 - $3,000 = $112,000.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 27:**

IAS 27 provides specific accounting options (cost, IFRS 9, or equity method) for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates when an entity presents separate financial statements. It does not deal with the consolidation process itself (which is IFRS 10) but focuses solely on the parent/investor's own books. The choice of accounting policy must be applied consistently. The standard ensures that users of separate financial statements receive relevant information about these investments and how they are accounted for, including disclosures about the nature of the investments and the accounting methods used. It is important to remember that separate financial statements are different from, and often prepared in addition to, consolidated financial statements (for parents) or financial statements where the equity method is applied (for associates/joint ventures under IAS 28).
