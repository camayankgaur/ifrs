## IAS 12: Income Taxes

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 12 is to prescribe the accounting treatment for income taxes. The principal issue in accounting for income taxes is how to account for the current and future tax consequences of the future recovery (settlement) of the carrying amount of assets (liabilities) that are recognised in an entity's statement of financial position and transactions and other events of the current period that have been recognised in an entity's financial statements.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Current Tax:** This is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period. It is calculated based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
2.  **Deferred Tax:** This arises from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax bases. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
3.  **Tax Base:** The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes.
4.  **Temporary Differences:** These are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base. Temporary differences can be either:
    *   **Taxable temporary differences:** Differences that will result in taxable amounts in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
    *   **Deductible temporary differences:** Differences that will result in amounts that are deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
5.  **Measurement:** Current and deferred tax should be measured using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end ofthe reporting period.
6.  **Presentation:** Tax expense (or income) is presented on the face of the statement of comprehensive income. Current tax and deferred tax are usually presented separately.

**Practical Application:**

Imagine a company, TechSolutions Inc., has a machine with a carrying amount of $10,000 and a tax base of $7,000. This means that for tax purposes, the company has already deducted $3,000 more in depreciation than it has for accounting purposes. This $3,000 difference is a taxable temporary difference because it will result in taxable income in future periods when the remaining $7,000 of the asset's value is recovered through use or sale. If the applicable tax rate is 20%, TechSolutions Inc. would recognize a deferred tax liability of $600 ($3,000 * 20%).

Conversely, if TechSolutions Inc. had an asset with a carrying amount of $12,000 and a tax base of $15,000 (e.g., due to accelerated depreciation for tax purposes), this would create a deductible temporary difference of $3,000. This difference could lead to a deferred tax asset of $600 ($3,000 * 20%), assuming it's probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   IAS 12 addresses the accounting for income taxes, including both current tax for the period and deferred tax arising from temporary differences.
*   The standard aims to ensure that the tax consequences of transactions and other events are recognized in the same period as the transactions and events themselves.
*   It requires careful calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, considering the probability of future taxable profit or loss.
*   Proper disclosure of tax-related information is crucial for users of financial statements to understand an entity's tax position and potential future tax liabilities or benefits.
