## IAS 36: Impairment of Assets

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets is to ensure that assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount. An asset is carried at more than its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset. If this is the case, the asset is described as impaired and the Standard requires the entity to recognise an impairment loss. The Standard also specifies when an entity should reverse an impairment loss and prescribes disclosures.

**Scope:** IAS 36 applies to all assets, other than: (a) inventories (see IAS 2 Inventories); (b) contract assets and assets arising from costs to obtain or fulfil a contract that are recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; (c) deferred tax assets (see IAS 12 Income Taxes); (d) assets arising from employee benefits (see IAS 19 Employee Benefits); (e) financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; (f) investment property that is measured at fair value (see IAS 40 Investment Property); (g) biological assets related to agricultural activity within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture that are measured at fair value less costs to sell; (h) deferred acquisition costs, and intangible assets, arising from an insurer’s contractual rights under insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts; and (i) non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Therefore, IAS 36 applies to assets such as property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures accounted for using the cost method or equity method.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Impairment loss:** The amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
*   **Carrying amount:** The amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciation (amortisation) and accumulated impairment losses thereon.
*   **Recoverable amount:** The higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
*   **Fair value:** The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (see IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).
*   **Costs of disposal:** Incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset or cash-generating unit, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
*   **Value in use (VIU):** The present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Estimating VIU involves: (a) estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal; and (b) applying an appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows.
*   **Cash-generating unit (CGU):** The smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

**Key Principles - Identifying an Asset that may be Impaired:**

An entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an entity shall also:
*   Test an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. This impairment test may be performed at any time during an annual period, provided it is performed at the same time each year.
*   Test goodwill acquired in a business combination for impairment annually.

**Indications of Impairment (External and Internal Sources):**
*   **External sources:** (a) Significant decline in the asset’s market value during the period, more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use. (b) Significant adverse changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which an asset is dedicated. (c) Increases in market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments, which are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value in use and decrease the asset’s recoverable amount materially. (d) The carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalisation.
*   **Internal sources:** (a) Evidence of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset. (b) Significant adverse changes with an impact on the entity have occurred during the period, or are expected to occur in the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be used (e.g., the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite). (c) Evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.

**Measuring Recoverable Amount:**
If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, its recoverable amount must be estimated. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, an entity determines the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.

**Recognising an Impairment Loss:**
If, and only if, the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) shall be reduced to its recoverable amount. That reduction is an impairment loss. An impairment loss shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at revalued amount in accordance with another Standard (e.g., the revaluation model in IAS 16). Any impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with that other Standard (i.e., to OCI to the extent of any revaluation surplus for that asset, then to P&L).
After the recognition of an impairment loss, the depreciation (amortisation) charge for the asset shall be adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

**Cash-Generating Units and Goodwill:**
*   If an active market exists for the output produced by an asset or group of assets, that asset or group of assets shall be identified as a CGU, even if some or all of its output is used internally.
*   Goodwill acquired in a business combination shall, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the acquirer’s CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall: (a) represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and (b) not be larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
*   A CGU to which goodwill has been allocated shall be tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of the unit exceeds the carrying amount of the unit, the unit and the goodwill allocated to that unit shall be regarded as not impaired. If the carrying amount of the unit exceeds the recoverable amount of the unit, the entity shall recognise an impairment loss. The impairment loss shall be allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit (group of units) in the following order: (a) first, to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of units); and (b) then, to the other assets of the unit (group of units) pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit (group of units). In allocating an impairment loss, an entity shall not reduce the carrying amount of an asset below the highest of: (i) its fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable); (ii) its value in use (if determinable); and (iii) zero.

**Reversing an Impairment Loss:**
An entity shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of that asset. An impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset shall be increased to its recoverable amount. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss.
The increased carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount under another IFRS (e.g., IAS 16), in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase under that IFRS.
**An impairment loss recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.**

**Disclosure:** IAS 36 requires extensive disclosures, including: for each class of assets, the amount of impairment losses and reversals recognised in profit or loss and in OCI; for material individual impairment losses or reversals, details about the events and circumstances that led to the recognition/reversal, the amount of the loss/reversal, and for an individual asset, the nature of the asset and the segment to which it belongs; information about the estimates used to measure recoverable amounts of CGUs containing goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

**Practical Example Scenario (Impairment of a Machine):**

ManuCo owns a machine with a carrying amount of $80,000 (Cost $120,000, Accumulated Depreciation $40,000). Due to a new competing technology, there is an indication of impairment.
*   Fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) is estimated to be $50,000.
*   Value in use (VIU) is calculated as the present value of future cash flows expected from the machine, estimated at $55,000.
*   Recoverable amount is the higher of FVLCD and VIU, so $55,000.
*   Carrying amount ($80,000) > Recoverable amount ($55,000).
*   Impairment loss = $80,000 - $55,000 = $25,000.

ManuCo recognises an impairment loss of $25,000 in profit or loss. The new carrying amount of the machine is $55,000. Future depreciation will be based on this new carrying amount over its remaining useful life.

**Practical Example Scenario (Impairment of a CGU with Goodwill):**

A CGU has the following carrying amounts: Goodwill $20,000; Other Assets $180,000. Total carrying amount = $200,000. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined to be $150,000.
*   Total impairment loss = $200,000 - $150,000 = $50,000.
*   Allocation of impairment loss:
    *   First, to Goodwill: Reduce Goodwill by $20,000 (to $0). Remaining impairment loss = $50,000 - $20,000 = $30,000.
    *   Then, to Other Assets: Reduce Other Assets by $30,000. New carrying amount of Other Assets = $180,000 - $30,000 = $150,000.
    (Assuming no individual asset in Other Assets would be reduced below its own recoverable amount or zero).

**Key Takeaways for IAS 36:**

IAS 36 is a critical standard for ensuring that an entity’s assets are not overstated in the financial statements. It requires entities to assess for indications of impairment at each reporting date and to perform annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The core of the standard is the comparison of an asset’s (or CGU’s) carrying amount with its recoverable amount (the higher of FVLCD and VIU). If impairment exists, an impairment loss is recognised. The standard also provides guidance on allocating impairment losses to assets within a CGU, particularly when goodwill is involved, and on the conditions for reversing impairment losses (except for goodwill, which cannot be reversed). Comprehensive disclosures are required to help users understand the impairment losses recognised and the estimates used in determining recoverable amounts.
