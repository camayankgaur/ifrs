## IAS 24: Related Party Disclosures

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures is to ensure that an entity’s financial statements contain the disclosures necessary to draw attention to the possibility that its financial position and profit or loss may have been affected by the existence of related parties and by transactions and outstanding balances, including commitments, with such parties. Transactions between related parties may not be made at the same amounts as between unrelated parties, and the existence of the relationship may affect the entity's risk and opportunities.

**Scope:** IAS 24 applies to: (a) identifying related party relationships and transactions; (b) identifying outstanding balances, including commitments, between an entity and its related parties; (c) identifying the circumstances in which disclosure of the items in (a) and (b) is required; and (d) determining the disclosures to be made about those items. This Standard requires disclosure of related party relationships, transactions and outstanding balances, including commitments, in the consolidated and separate financial statements of a parent, venturer or investor presented in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements or IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements. This Standard also applies to individual financial statements.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Related party:** A person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (the reporting entity). A person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that person: (i) has control or joint control over the reporting entity; (ii) has significant influence over the reporting entity; or (iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.
    An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies: (i) The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others). (ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member). (iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party. (iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity. (v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity. (vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (1). (vii) A person identified in (1)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity). (viii) The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.
*   **Related party transaction:** A transfer of resources, services or obligations between a reporting entity and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.
*   **Close members of the family of a person:** Those family members who may be expected to influence, or be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity. They may include: (a) that person’s children and spouse or domestic partner; (b) children of that person’s spouse or domestic partner; and (c) dependants of that person or that person’s spouse or domestic partner.
*   **Key management personnel:** Those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity.
*   **Control:** The power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
*   **Joint control:** The contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity.
*   **Significant influence:** The power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity, but not control over those policies.

**Disclosure Requirements:**

1.  **Relationships between parents and subsidiaries:** Regardless of whether there have been transactions between a parent and its subsidiaries, an entity must disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate controlling party. If neither the entity’s parent nor the ultimate controlling party produces consolidated financial statements available for public use, the name of the next most senior parent that does so must also be disclosed.

2.  **Key Management Personnel Compensation:** An entity shall disclose key management personnel compensation in total and for each of the following categories: (a) short-term employee benefits; (b) post-employment benefits; (c) other long-term benefits; (d) termination benefits; and (e) share-based payment.

3.  **Related Party Transactions:** If there have been transactions between related parties, an entity shall disclose the nature of the related party relationship as well as information about those transactions and outstanding balances, including commitments, necessary for users to understand the potential effect of the relationship on the financial statements. These disclosure requirements are additional to those in item 1. At a minimum, disclosures shall include: (a) the amount of the transactions; (b) the amount of outstanding balances, including commitments, and: (i) their terms and conditions, including whether they are secured, and the nature of the consideration to be provided in settlement; and (ii) details of any guarantees given or received; (c) provisions for doubtful debts related to the amount of outstanding balances; and (d) the expense recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from related parties.
    Transactions to be disclosed include purchases or sales of goods, purchases or sales of property and other assets, rendering or receiving of services, leases, transfers of research and development, transfers under licence agreements, transfers under finance arrangements (including loans and equity contributions in cash or in kind), provision of guarantees or collateral, commitments to do something if a particular event occurs or does not occur in the future, including executory contracts, and settlement of liabilities on behalf of the entity or by the entity on behalf of another party.
    Disclosures that related party transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions are made only if such terms can be substantiated.
    Items of a similar nature may be disclosed in aggregate except when separate disclosure is necessary for an understanding of the effects of related party transactions on the financial statements of the entity.

4.  **Government-related entities:** A reporting entity is exempt from the disclosure requirements of paragraph 3 in relation to related party transactions and outstanding balances, including commitments, with: (a) a government that has control, joint control or significant influence over the reporting entity; and (b) another entity that is a related party because the same government has control, joint control or significant influence over both the reporting entity and the other entity. If a reporting entity applies this exemption, it shall disclose the following about the transactions and related outstanding balances referred to above: (a) the name of the government and the nature of its relationship with the reporting entity (ie, control, joint control or significant influence); (b) the following information in sufficient detail to enable users of the entity’s financial statements to understand the effect of related party transactions on its financial statements: (i) the nature and amount of each individually significant transaction; and (ii) for other transactions that are collectively, but not individually, significant, a qualitative or quantitative indication of their extent.

**Practical Example Scenario (Transactions with Key Management Personnel):**

Innovate Ltd. is preparing its financial statements. The CEO of Innovate Ltd., Ms. Jane Doe, also owns 100% of SupplyCo, a company that provides Innovate Ltd. with specialised components. During the year, Innovate Ltd. purchased components from SupplyCo for $200,000. At year-end, Innovate Ltd. owed SupplyCo $30,000 for these purchases. The terms of these purchases are comparable to arm's length transactions.

Innovate Ltd. would need to disclose:
*   The nature of the related party relationship (CEO of Innovate Ltd. controls SupplyCo).
*   The amount of the purchases from SupplyCo ($200,000).
*   The outstanding balance owed to SupplyCo at year-end ($30,000), along with terms and conditions (e.g., unsecured, payable within 30 days).
*   A statement that the transactions were made on terms equivalent to arm's length transactions, if this can be substantiated.

Additionally, Innovate Ltd. would disclose the total compensation paid to its key management personnel (including Ms. Doe), broken down by category (short-term benefits, post-employment benefits, etc.).

**Practical Example Scenario (Parent-Subsidiary Relationship):**

Alpha Corp owns 80% of Beta Ltd. During the year, Alpha Corp provided management services to Beta Ltd. for a fee of $50,000. Alpha Corp also provided Beta Ltd. with an interest-free loan of $100,000, which is outstanding at year-end.

Beta Ltd. (the reporting entity) would disclose:
*   The name of its parent (Alpha Corp) and the ultimate controlling party if different.
*   The nature of the related party relationship (parent-subsidiary).
*   Details of the management services transaction: amount ($50,000).
*   Details of the loan: amount outstanding ($100,000), terms (interest-free, repayment schedule if any), and whether it's secured.

Alpha Corp, in its consolidated financial statements, would eliminate these intercompany transactions and balances. However, in its separate financial statements (if prepared), Alpha Corp would also need to make appropriate related party disclosures regarding its transactions with Beta Ltd.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 24:**

IAS 24 is crucial for transparency in financial reporting. It ensures that users are aware of transactions and balances with related parties, which might not have occurred, or might have occurred on different terms, if the parties were unrelated. The definition of a related party is broad and encompasses control, joint control, significant influence, and key management personnel. Disclosures include the nature of relationships, details of transactions (amounts, terms, balances), and compensation of key management personnel. Special considerations apply to government-related entities. The overarching goal is to provide users with sufficient information to assess the impact of related party relationships on an entity's financial position and performance.
