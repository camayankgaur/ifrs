## IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures

**Objective:** The objective of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate: (a) the significance of financial instruments for the entity’s financial position and performance; and (b) the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the end of the reporting period, and how the entity manages those risks. The disclosures are intended to help users understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of an entity’s future cash flows.

**Scope:** IFRS 7 applies to all entities and to all types of financial instruments, except for those interests in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements, or IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. However, in some cases, IFRS 10, IAS 27 or IAS 28 permit an entity to account for an interest in a subsidiary, associate or joint venture in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; in those cases, entities apply the requirements of IFRS 7. It also applies to contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that are within the scope of IFRS 9. The standard applies to both recognised and unrecognised financial instruments (e.g., some loan commitments).

**Key Principles and Categories of Disclosures:**

IFRS 7 groups disclosures into two main categories: disclosures about the significance of financial instruments, and disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments.

**1. Significance of Financial Instruments:**
   These disclosures aim to help users understand the impact of financial instruments on an entity's financial position and performance. They include:

   *   **Statement of Financial Position Disclosures:**
       *   **Carrying amounts of each class of financial assets and financial liabilities:** Classes are determined by the entity and are based on the nature of the instruments. Disclosures are required for each class, distinguishing between those measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and amortised cost.
       *   **Financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL:** Details about amounts designated as at FVTPL, criteria for designation, and information about credit risk for designated liabilities.
       *   **Reclassification:** Information about reclassifications of financial assets between measurement categories.
       *   **Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities:** Disclosures about financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset.
       *   **Collateral:** Information about financial assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities, and the terms and conditions relating to pledged assets. Also, information about collateral held (financial or non-financial assets) that the entity is permitted to sell or repledge.
       *   **Allowance account for credit losses:** Reconciliation of the allowance account for expected credit losses for financial assets measured at FVOCI and those measured at amortised cost.
       *   **Compound financial instruments with multiple embedded derivatives.**
       *   **Defaults and breaches:** Details of any defaults of principal, interest, sinking fund, or redemption terms of loans payable during the period, and any other breaches of loan agreements.

   *   **Statement of Comprehensive Income Disclosures:**
       *   **Items of income, expense, gains, or losses:** Disclosure of net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument (e.g., those measured at FVTPL, FVOCI, amortised cost), interest income and expense (calculated using the effective interest method), fee income and expense, impairment losses, and foreign exchange gains and losses.
       *   **Interest income on impaired financial assets.**

   *   **Other Disclosures:**
       *   **Accounting policies:** Disclosure of the measurement basis (or bases) used for financial instruments and other accounting policies relevant to an understanding of the financial statements.
       *   **Hedge accounting:** Extensive disclosures are required about an entity’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk, how hedging activities may affect the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows, and the effect that hedge accounting has had on the entity’s statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity. This includes details about the types of hedges, financial instruments designated as hedging instruments, and the nature of the risks being hedged.
       *   **Fair value:** For all financial instruments, IFRS 7 requires disclosure of their fair values (unless the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value, e.g., for short-term trade receivables and payables). Disclosures are required about how fair values are determined, including valuation techniques and inputs used. A fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs) is used to classify fair value measurements, with detailed disclosures for Level 3 measurements (those based on unobservable inputs).

**2. Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments:**
   These disclosures focus on the risks that an entity is exposed to because of its use of financial instruments. The main risks are credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk (which includes currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk). For each type of risk, an entity must disclose:

   *   **Qualitative disclosures:** Exposure to the risk and how it arises; objectives, policies, and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk; and any changes in these from the previous period.
   *   **Quantitative disclosures:** Summary quantitative data about its exposure to that risk at the reporting date. This is usually based on information provided internally to key management personnel.

   *   **Credit Risk Disclosures:**
       *   Maximum exposure to credit risk (without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements).
       *   Information about collateral held and other credit enhancements.
       *   Information about the credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired.
       *   For financial assets that are past due or impaired, an analysis of their age and the factors considered in determining that they are impaired.
       *   Specific disclosures about expected credit losses, including inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used.

   *   **Liquidity Risk Disclosures:**
       *   A maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities (including issued financial guarantee contracts) that shows the remaining contractual maturities.
       *   A maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities.
       *   A description of how the entity manages the liquidity risk inherent in the above.

   *   **Market Risk Disclosures:**
       *   **Sensitivity analysis:** For each type of market risk (currency risk, interest rate risk, other price risk), a sensitivity analysis showing how profit or loss and equity would have been affected by reasonably possible changes in the relevant risk variable at the reporting date. If an entity prepares a sensitivity analysis, such as value-at-risk, that reflects interdependencies between risk variables (eg interest rates and exchange rates) and uses it to manage financial risks, it may use that sensitivity analysis in place of the one described above.
       *   Additional information if the sensitivity analysis is not representative of the risks inherent in a financial instrument.
       *   Specific disclosures for interest rate risk, including information about fixed versus floating rate instruments.
       *   Specific disclosures for currency risk, including the currencies to which the entity is exposed.

**Practical Example Scenario (Illustrative - Focus on one aspect):**

Global Corp holds a significant portfolio of bonds issued by various entities and also has taken out several loans denominated in foreign currencies. Users of its financial statements need to understand the risks associated with these instruments.

*   **Credit Risk Disclosure:** For its bond portfolio, Global Corp would disclose the carrying amount of bonds, categorised by credit rating (e.g., AAA, AA, A, BBB, etc., using an external rating agency or internal ratings). It would also disclose its maximum exposure to credit risk, any collateral held (though often not applicable for bonds), and a reconciliation of the allowance for expected credit losses, showing movements during the year. If some bonds are past due or impaired, further details would be provided.

*   **Currency Risk Disclosure (Market Risk):** For its foreign currency loans, Global Corp would disclose the nominal amounts of loans by currency (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY). It would then perform a sensitivity analysis. For example, it might state:
