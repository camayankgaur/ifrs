## IAS 23: Borrowing Costs

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 23 Borrowing Costs is to prescribe the accounting treatment for borrowing costs. The Standard generally requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

**Scope:** IAS 23 applies to accounting for borrowing costs. It does not deal with the actual or imputed cost of equity, including preferred capital not classified as a liability. An entity is not required to apply the Standard to borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of: (a) a qualifying asset measured at fair value, for example, a biological asset within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture; or (b) inventories that are manufactured, or otherwise produced, in large quantities on a repetitive basis.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Borrowing costs:** Interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs may include: interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in IFRS 9, finance charges in respect of finance leases recognised in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.
*   **Qualifying asset:** An asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Examples include inventories that require a substantial period to bring them to a saleable condition, manufacturing plants, power generation facilities, intangible assets, investment properties, and bearer plants.

**Key Principles - Recognition:**

1.  **Capitalisation of Borrowing Costs:** An entity shall capitalise borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. An entity shall recognise other borrowing costs as an expense in the period in which it incurs them.

2.  **Borrowing Costs Eligible for Capitalisation:**
    *   **Specific Borrowings:** To the extent that an entity borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the entity shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings.
    *   **General Borrowings:** To the extent that an entity borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the entity shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during a period shall not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during that period.

3.  **Commencement of Capitalisation:** An entity shall begin capitalising borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset on the commencement date. The commencement date for capitalisation is the date when the entity first meets all of the following conditions:
    *   (a) it incurs expenditures for the asset;
    *   (b) it incurs borrowing costs; and
    *   (c) it undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.
    Activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale encompass more than the physical construction of the asset. They include technical and administrative work prior to the commencement of physical construction, such as the activities associated with obtaining permits prior to the commencement of the physical construction. However, such activities exclude the holding of an asset when no production or development that changes the asset’s condition is taking place.

4.  **Suspension of Capitalisation:** An entity shall suspend capitalisation of borrowing costs during extended periods in which it suspends active development of a qualifying asset. An entity does not normally suspend capitalising borrowing costs during a period when it carries out substantial technical and administrative work. An entity also does not suspend capitalising borrowing costs when a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use or sale.

5.  **Cessation of Capitalisation:** An entity shall cease capitalising borrowing costs when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are complete. An asset is normally ready for its intended use or sale when its physical construction is complete even though routine administrative work might still continue. If minor modifications, such as the decoration of a property to the purchaser’s or user’s specification, are all that are outstanding, this indicates that substantially all the activities are complete.
    When an entity completes the construction of a qualifying asset in parts and each part is capable of being used while construction continues on other parts, the entity shall cease capitalising borrowing costs when it completes substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that part for its intended use or sale.

**Disclosure:** The financial statements shall disclose:
*   The accounting policy adopted for borrowing costs.
*   The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the period.
*   The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation (if determined from general borrowings).

**Practical Example Scenario (Specific and General Borrowings):**

ConstructCo is building a new factory (a qualifying asset). Construction started on January 1, 20X1, and is expected to take 2 years. Expenditures on the factory were made evenly throughout 20X1, totaling $2,400,000 for the year.

*   **Specific Borrowing:** ConstructCo took out a specific loan of $1,000,000 on January 1, 20X1, at an interest rate of 6% per annum, specifically for the factory construction. During 20X1, $200,000 of this loan was temporarily invested and earned interest of $5,000.
    *   Borrowing costs from specific loan: $1,000,000 * 6% = $60,000.
    *   Investment income: $5,000.
    *   Net borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation from specific loan: $60,000 - $5,000 = $55,000.

*   **General Borrowings:** ConstructCo also had the following general borrowings outstanding during 20X1:
    *   Loan A: $2,000,000 at 5% per annum.
    *   Loan B: $3,000,000 at 7% per annum.
    *   Weighted average capitalisation rate for general borrowings:
        *   Interest on Loan A: $2,000,000 * 5% = $100,000.
        *   Interest on Loan B: $3,000,000 * 7% = $210,000.
        *   Total interest from general borrowings: $100,000 + $210,000 = $310,000.
        *   Total general borrowings: $2,000,000 + $3,000,000 = $5,000,000.
        *   Weighted average rate: $310,000 / $5,000,000 = 6.2%.

*   **Expenditures Financed by General Borrowings:**
    *   Average expenditure on the asset during 20X1: $2,400,000 / 2 = $1,200,000 (assuming even spend).
    *   Expenditure financed by specific borrowing: $1,000,000 (assuming the specific loan was fully utilized before general borrowings were used for the qualifying asset, or based on average specific loan outstanding applied to the asset).
    *   Let's assume the average outstanding specific loan applied to the asset was $1,000,000. Then average expenditure financed by general borrowings = $1,200,000 (average total expenditure) - $1,000,000 (average specific loan portion) = $200,000. (Note: The calculation of average expenditure financed by general borrowings can be complex and depends on the timing of expenditures and use of specific funds.)
    *   Alternatively, if we consider the total expenditure of $2,400,000, and $1,000,000 was from specific borrowings, then $1,400,000 of the *total* expenditure was financed by general borrowings. The capitalisation is on the *average* accumulated expenditure. If $1,000,000 of the specific loan was drawn down on Jan 1 and applied to the asset, the average outstanding specific loan applied to the asset is $1,000,000. The average total expenditure is $1,200,000. So, the average expenditure financed by general borrowings is $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000.
    *   Borrowing costs to capitalise from general borrowings: $200,000 * 6.2% = $12,400.

*   **Total Borrowing Costs Capitalised in 20X1:** $55,000 (from specific) + $12,400 (from general) = $67,400.
    This $67,400 would be added to the cost of the factory. The remaining borrowing costs incurred by ConstructCo during the year would be expensed.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 23:**

IAS 23 mandates the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset. This means these costs become part of the asset's cost rather than being expensed immediately. The standard provides clear criteria for identifying qualifying assets, determining the amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised (distinguishing between specific and general borrowings), and when to start, suspend, and cease capitalisation. Proper application ensures that the cost of a qualifying asset more accurately reflects the total investment required to bring it to its intended use or sale. Disclosure requirements provide transparency regarding the amount of borrowing costs capitalised and the capitalisation rate used.
