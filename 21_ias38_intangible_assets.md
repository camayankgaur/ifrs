## IAS 38: Intangible Assets

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 38 Intangible Assets is to prescribe the accounting treatment for intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another IFRS. The Standard requires an entity to recognise an intangible asset if, and only if, specified criteria are met. The Standard also specifies how to measure the carrying amount of intangible assets and requires specified disclosures about intangible assets.

**Scope:** IAS 38 applies to all intangible assets except: (a) intangible assets that are within the scope of another Standard (e.g., goodwill acquired in a business combination (IFRS 3), deferred tax assets (IAS 12), lease assets (IFRS 16), assets arising from employee benefits (IAS 19), financial assets (IFRS 9)); (b) exploration and evaluation assets (IFRS 6); and (c) expenditure on the development and extraction of minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. It also does not apply to intangible assets arising from insurance contracts issued by an insurer (IFRS 17).

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Intangible asset:** An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is a resource: (a) controlled by an entity as a result of past events; and (b) from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.
*   **Identifiability:** An intangible asset is identifiable if it either: (a) is separable, i.e. is capable of being separated or divided from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, identifiable asset or liability, regardless of whether the entity intends to do so; or (b) arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.
*   **Control:** An entity controls an asset if the entity has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits.
*   **Future economic benefits:** May include revenue from the sale of products or services, cost savings, or other benefits resulting from the use of the asset by the entity.
*   **Research:** Original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
*   **Development:** The application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use.
*   **Amortisation:** The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an intangible asset over its useful life.
*   **Useful life:** The period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by an entity; or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by an entity.

**Key Principles - Recognition and Measurement:**
An intangible asset shall be recognised if, and only if:
1.  It is **probable** that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and
2.  The **cost** of the asset can be measured reliably.

*   **Separate Acquisition:** If an intangible asset is acquired separately, its cost can usually be measured reliably. The cost comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; and any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use.
*   **Acquisition as Part of a Business Combination:** The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the acquisition date (see IFRS 3 Business Combinations).
*   **Acquisition by way of a Government Grant:** Intangible assets acquired by way of a government grant may be recorded at fair value, or at a nominal amount plus any expenditure that is directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use (see IAS 20).
*   **Exchanges of Assets:** An intangible asset may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. The cost of such an intangible asset is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.
*   **Internally Generated Goodwill:** Internally generated goodwill shall not be recognised as an asset.
*   **Internally Generated Intangible Assets (Other than Goodwill):** To assess whether an internally generated intangible asset meets the criteria for recognition, an entity classifies the generation of the asset into: (a) a research phase; and (b) a development phase.
    *   **Research Phase:** No intangible asset arising from research (or from the research phase of an internal project) shall be recognised. Expenditure on research shall be recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
    *   **Development Phase:** An intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) shall be recognised if, and only if, an entity can demonstrate all of the following (the PIRATE criteria are a common mnemonic, though not explicitly from the standard):
        *   **(P)robable future economic benefits:** The intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
        *   **(I)ntention to complete:** The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.
        *   **(R)esources adequate:** The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.
        *   **(A)bility to use or sell:** The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.
        *   **(T)echnical feasibility:** The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
        *   **(E)xpenditure reliably measured:** The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
    If an entity cannot distinguish the research phase from the development phase of an internal project to create an intangible asset, the entity treats the expenditure on that project as if it were incurred in the research phase only.
    Internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance shall not be recognised as intangible assets.

**Measurement After Recognition:** An entity shall choose either the cost model or the revaluation model as its accounting policy. If an intangible asset is accounted for using the revaluation model, all the other assets in its class shall also be accounted for using the same model, unless there is no active market for those assets.
*   **Cost Model:** After initial recognition, an intangible asset shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
*   **Revaluation Model:** After initial recognition, an intangible asset shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated amortisation and any subsequent accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of revaluations under this Standard, fair value shall be measured by reference to an active market. Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. If an intangible asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.
    The revaluation model is not permitted for goodwill.

**Useful Life:** An entity shall assess whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.
*   **Finite Useful Life:** The depreciable amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life (amortisation). Amortisation shall begin when the asset is available for use. The amortisation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used. The amortisation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss unless another Standard permits or requires it to be included in the carrying amount of another asset. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life shall be reviewed at least at each financial year-end.
*   **Indefinite Useful Life:** An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life shall not be amortised. An intangible asset is regarded by the entity as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity. The useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortised shall be reviewed each period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. If they do not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite shall be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment, in accordance with IAS 36.

**Derecognition:** An intangible asset shall be derecognised: (a) on disposal; or (b) when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset shall be determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It shall be recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

**Disclosure:** IAS 38 requires extensive disclosures, including for each class of intangible assets, distinguishing between internally generated intangible assets and other intangible assets: (a) whether the useful lives are indefinite or finite and, if finite, the useful lives or the amortisation rates used; (b) the amortisation methods used for intangible assets with finite useful lives; (c) the gross carrying amount and any accumulated amortisation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the period; (d) a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period showing additions, disposals, revaluations, impairments, reversals of impairments, amortisation, and other movements; (e) information about intangible assets acquired by way of government grant; (f) information about intangible assets whose title is restricted and the carrying amount of intangible assets pledged as security for liabilities; (g) the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of intangible assets; (h) for intangible assets assessed as having an indefinite useful life, the carrying amount of that asset and the reasons supporting the assessment of an indefinite useful life; (i) a description, the carrying amount and remaining amortisation period of any individual intangible asset that is material to the entity’s financial statements; (j) the aggregate amount of research and development expenditure recognised as an expense during the period.

**Practical Example Scenario (Development Costs Capitalisation):**

TechDev Co. is developing a new software product. During 20X1, it incurred $200,000 on research activities and $300,000 on development activities. TechDev Co. can demonstrate all six criteria (PIRATE) for capitalising development costs from July 1, 20X1, when $150,000 of the development costs had been incurred. The remaining $150,000 of development costs were incurred after this date.
*   Research costs of $200,000 are expensed as incurred.
*   Development costs incurred before July 1, 20X1 ($150,000) are expensed as the criteria for capitalisation were not yet met.
*   Development costs incurred from July 1, 20X1, onwards ($150,000) are capitalised as an intangible asset, assuming all criteria continue to be met.
*   The software is completed and available for use on January 1, 20X2. Amortisation will begin from this date over its estimated useful life.

**Practical Example Scenario (Acquired Brand):**

FoodCo acquires a well-known brand name, "TastyTreats", as part of a business combination for an allocated cost of $500,000. The brand is expected to generate cash flows for an indefinite period. FoodCo classifies the brand as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. It will not be amortised but will be tested for impairment annually (or more frequently if indicators exist) under IAS 36. If FoodCo had tried to internally generate a brand, the costs would have been expensed as incurred.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 38:**

IAS 38 provides comprehensive guidance on accounting for intangible assets, distinguishing between acquired and internally generated assets, and between research and development phases for the latter. Strict criteria must be met for capitalisation, particularly for internally generated development costs. The standard allows a choice between the cost model and the revaluation model (if an active market exists) for subsequent measurement. A key aspect is assessing whether an intangible asset has a finite or indefinite useful life, which dictates whether it is amortised or only tested for impairment. Extensive disclosures are required to provide transparency about an entity’s intangible assets.
