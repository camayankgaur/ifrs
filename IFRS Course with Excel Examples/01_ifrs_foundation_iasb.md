### Understanding the IFRS Foundation and the IASB

The IFRS Foundation is a not-for-profit, public interest organisation established to develop a single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable, and globally accepted accounting standards—IFRS Standards—and to promote and facilitate their adoption. The Foundation is governed by a board of Trustees, who are responsible for the governance and oversight of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as well as other bodies such as the IFRS Interpretations Committee and the IFRS Advisory Council. The Trustees are also responsible for securing the funding for the organisation, which comes from a variety of sources including national funding regimes, contributions from international accounting firms, and sales of publications.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is the independent standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation. Its members are responsible for the development and publication of IFRS Accounting Standards, including the IFRS for SMEs Standard. The IASB follows a thorough, open, and transparent due process when developing or amending standards, which includes public consultation and engagement with stakeholders worldwide. This process is designed to ensure that the standards are of high quality and meet the needs of users of financial statements. The IASB comprises 14 full-time members with a mix of backgrounds, including auditors, preparers of financial statements, users of financial statements, and academics, all chosen for their technical expertise and international experience. The primary objective of the IASB is to develop standards that bring transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial markets around the world, fostering trust, growth, and long-term financial stability.
