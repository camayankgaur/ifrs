## IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation is to establish principles for presenting financial instruments as liabilities or equity and for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. It applies to the classification of financial instruments, from the perspective of the issuer, into financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments; the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and gains; and the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities should be offset.

**Scope:** IAS 32 applies to all types of financial instruments except for: (a) interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements or IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (however, in some cases, IFRS 10, IAS 27 or IAS 28 permit an entity to account for an interest in a subsidiary, associate or joint venture in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; in those cases, entities apply the requirements of this Standard); (b) employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans, to which IAS 19 Employee Benefits applies; (c) insurance contracts as defined in IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (however, IAS 32 applies to derivatives embedded in insurance contracts if IFRS 9 requires the entity to account for them separately, and to financial instruments that it issues with a discretionary participation feature if the entity applies IFRS 17 to those features); (d) financial instruments that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment because they meet the definition of an equity instrument issued in a share-based payment transaction; and (e) contracts and obligations within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers that are financial instruments, except for those that IFRS 15 specifies are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Financial instrument:** Any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
*   **Financial asset:** Any asset that is: (a) cash; (b) an equity instrument of another entity; (c) a contractual right: (i) to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or (ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity; or (d) a contract that will or may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments and is: (i) a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity’s own equity instruments; or (ii) a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments.
*   **Financial liability:** Any liability that is: (a) a contractual obligation: (i) to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or (ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; or (b) a contract that will or may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments and is: (i) a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of the entity’s own equity instruments; or (ii) a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments.
*   **Equity instrument:** Any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
*   **Fair value:** The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (see IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).

**Key Principles - Presentation:**

1.  **Liability vs. Equity Classification:** The issuer of a financial instrument shall classify the instrument, or its component parts, on initial recognition as a financial liability, a financial asset or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of a financial liability, a financial asset and an equity instrument. The critical feature that distinguishes a financial liability from an equity instrument is the existence of a contractual obligation of one party to the financial instrument (the issuer) either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the other party (the holder) or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.
    *   If the instrument includes a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, it is a financial liability, even if the amount of cash or other financial assets is determined on the basis of an index or other item that has the potential to increase or decrease, or if the legal form of the instrument is that of an equity share.
    *   An instrument is an equity instrument only if: (a) the instrument includes no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer; and (b) if the instrument will or may be settled in the issuer’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no contractual obligation for the issuer to deliver a variable number of its own equity instruments, or a derivative that will be settled only by the issuer exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments (the ‘fixed-for-fixed’ criterion).
    *   **Puttable instruments and instruments that impose an obligation on the entity to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation:** Certain instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability are classified as equity if they have all the specified features and meet certain conditions (e.g., puttable shares, certain instruments issued by co-operative entities).

2.  **Compound Financial Instruments:** The issuer of a non-derivative financial instrument shall evaluate the terms of the financial instrument to determine whether it contains both a liability and an equity component. Such components shall be classified separately as financial liabilities, financial assets or equity instruments. For example, a convertible bond or similar instrument that is convertible by the holder into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the issuer is a compound financial instrument. From the issuer’s perspective, such an instrument comprises two components: a financial liability (a contractual arrangement to deliver cash or another financial asset) and an equity instrument (a call option granting the holder the right, for a specified period of time, to convert it into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the issuer). The issuer allocates the initial carrying amount of the compound instrument to its liability and equity components. The liability component is typically determined first by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. The equity component is then assigned the residual amount.

3.  **Treasury Shares:** If an entity reacquires its own equity instruments, those instruments (‘treasury shares’) shall be deducted from equity. No gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of an entity’s own equity instruments. Consideration paid or received shall be recognised directly in equity.

4.  **Interest, Dividends, Losses and Gains:** Interest, dividends, losses and gains relating to a financial instrument or a component that is a financial liability shall be recognised as income or expense in profit or loss. Distributions to holders of an equity instrument shall be recognised by the entity directly in equity. Transaction costs of an equity transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity.

5.  **Offsetting a Financial Asset and a Financial Liability:** A financial asset and a financial liability shall be offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, an entity: (a) currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and (b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The existence of an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, in the absence of an intention to settle net or simultaneously, is not sufficient to justify offsetting.

**Disclosure:** The disclosure requirements relating to the presentation of financial instruments are primarily found in IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. IAS 32 itself requires disclosure of information about an entity’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital if those disclosures are not made elsewhere in the financial statements.

**Practical Example Scenario (Convertible Bond):**

On January 1, 20X1, Company X issues 1,000 convertible bonds at par. Each bond has a face value of $1,000, thus total proceeds are $1,000,000. The bonds pay annual interest at 6% and mature in 5 years. Each bond is convertible into 200 ordinary shares of Company X. The market interest rate for similar bonds without conversion rights is 8%.

1.  **Calculate the liability component:** This is the present value of the contractually determined stream of future cash flows (interest and principal) discounted at the market interest rate for similar non-convertible bonds (8%).
    *   Annual interest payment: $1,000,000 * 6% = $60,000.
    *   Present value of principal repayment: $1,000,000 / (1.08)^5 = $680,583.
    *   Present value of annuity of interest payments: $60,000 * [1 - (1.08)^-5] / 0.08 = $60,000 * 3.9927 = $239,562.
    *   Total liability component: $680,583 + $239,562 = $920,145.

2.  **Calculate the equity component:** This is the residual amount after deducting the liability component from the total proceeds.
    *   Total proceeds: $1,000,000.
    *   Liability component: $920,145.
    *   Equity component (conversion option): $1,000,000 - $920,145 = $79,855.

**Journal Entry on Issuance:**
Debit Cash $1,000,000
    Credit Bonds Payable (Liability) $920,145
    Credit Equity - Conversion Option $79,855

Subsequently, the liability component is accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (8% in this case). The equity component remains in equity and is not remeasured. If the bonds are converted, the carrying amount of the liability component and the equity component are transferred to share capital and share premium.

**Practical Example Scenario (Preference Shares):**

*   **Mandatorily Redeemable Preference Shares:** If Company Y issues preference shares that require it to redeem them for cash on a specific date or at the option of the holder, these are classified as a financial liability. Dividends paid on these shares are treated as interest expense.
*   **Non-Redeemable Preference Shares (at issuer's discretion):** If Company Z issues preference shares where redemption is solely at Company Z’s discretion and dividends are also discretionary, these would typically be classified as equity. Dividends paid would be a distribution of profit, debited to equity.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 32:**

IAS 32 is crucial for determining whether a financial instrument (or its components) should be classified as a financial liability or an equity instrument from the issuer's perspective. This classification is based on the substance of the contractual arrangement, particularly the existence of a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset. The standard provides detailed guidance on this distinction, including for compound instruments like convertible bonds, which must be split into their liability and equity components. It also covers the accounting for treasury shares and the conditions for offsetting financial assets and liabilities. Correct classification under IAS 32 significantly impacts the presentation of an entity’s financial position and performance, affecting metrics such as gearing ratios and reported profit.
