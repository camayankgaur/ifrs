## IAS 10: Events after the Reporting Period

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period is to prescribe: (a) when an entity should adjust its financial statements for events after the reporting period; and (b) the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the financial statements were authorised for issue and about events after the reporting period.

**Scope:** IAS 10 applies to the accounting for, and disclosure of, events after the reporting period. Events after the reporting period are those events, favourable and unfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Two types of events can be identified:

1.  **Adjusting events:** Those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period.
2.  **Non-adjusting events:** Those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the reporting period.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Adjusting Events after the Reporting Period:** An entity **shall adjust** the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. Examples of adjusting events include:
    *   The settlement after the reporting period of a court case that confirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The entity adjusts any previously recognised provision related to this court case in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, or recognises a new provision.
    *   The receipt of information after the reporting period indicating that an asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period, or that the amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that asset needs to be adjusted. For example: (i) the bankruptcy of a customer that occurs after the reporting period usually confirms that a loss existed at the end of the reporting period on a trade receivable and that the entity needs to adjust the carrying amount of the trade receivable; and (ii) the sale of inventories after the reporting period may give evidence about their net realisable value at the end of the reporting period.
    *   The determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets purchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of the reporting period.
    *   The determination after the reporting period of the amount of profit-sharing or bonus payments, if the entity had a present legal or constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to make such payments as a result of past events.
    *   The discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial statements are incorrect.

*   **Non-adjusting Events after the Reporting Period:** An entity **shall not adjust** the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect non-adjusting events after the reporting period. If non-adjusting events are material, non-disclosure could influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements. Accordingly, an entity shall disclose the following for each material category of non-adjusting event after the reporting period: (a) the nature of the event; and (b) an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. Examples of non-adjusting events include:
    *   A major business combination after the reporting period (IFRS 3 Business Combinations specifies particular disclosures in such cases) or disposing of a major subsidiary.
    *   Announcing a plan to discontinue an operation.
    *   Major purchases of assets, classification of assets as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, other disposals of assets, or expropriation of major assets by government.
    *   The destruction of a major production plant by a fire after the reporting period.
    *   Announcing, or commencing the implementation of, a major restructuring.
    *   Major ordinary share transactions and potential ordinary share transactions after the reporting period.
    *   Abnormally large changes after the reporting period in asset prices or foreign exchange rates.
    *   Changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced after the reporting period that have a significant effect on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
    *   Entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities, for example, by issuing significant guarantees.
    *   Commencing major litigation arising solely out of events that occurred after the reporting period.

*   **Dividends:** If an entity declares dividends to holders of equity instruments (as defined in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation) after the reporting period, the entity **shall not recognise** those dividends as a liability at the end of the reporting period. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

*   **Going Concern:** An entity shall not prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis if management determines after the reporting period either that it intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or that it has no realistic alternative but to do so. A deterioration in operating results and financial position after the reporting period may indicate a need to consider whether the going concern assumption is still appropriate. If the going concern assumption is no longer appropriate, the effect is so pervasive that this Standard requires a fundamental change in the basis of accounting, rather than an adjustment to the amounts recognised within the original basis of accounting.

**Disclosure:**

*   **Date of authorisation for issue:** An entity shall disclose the date when the financial statements were authorised for issue and who gave that authorisation. If the entityâ€™s owners or others have the power to amend the financial statements after issue, the entity shall disclose that fact.
*   **Updating disclosure about conditions at the end of the reporting period:** If an entity receives information after the reporting period about conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, it shall update disclosures that relate to those conditions, in the light of the new information.
*   **Non-adjusting events after the reporting period:** As mentioned above, for material non-adjusting events, the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial effect (or a statement that an estimate cannot be made) must be disclosed.

**Practical Example Scenario (Adjusting Event):**

Alpha Corp has a year-end of December 31, 20X1. In November 20X1, a customer owing $100,000 was experiencing financial difficulties. Alpha Corp made a provision for expected credit losses of $40,000 against this receivable at December 31, 20X1. In February 20X2, before the financial statements for 20X1 were authorised for issue, Alpha Corp was informed that the customer had declared bankruptcy and it was highly unlikely any amount would be recovered.

This bankruptcy provides additional evidence of a condition (the customer's inability to pay) that existed at the reporting date. Therefore, it is an adjusting event. Alpha Corp should adjust its 20X1 financial statements to increase the provision for expected credit losses on this receivable to $100,000, recognising an additional loss of $60,000.

**Practical Example Scenario (Non-Adjusting Event):**

Beta Inc. has a year-end of December 31, 20X1. On January 15, 20X2, a fire destroyed one of Beta Inc.
's major warehouses, causing uninsured damage estimated at $5 million. The financial statements for 20X1 are authorised for issue on March 1, 20X2.

The fire occurred after the reporting date and is indicative of conditions that arose after December 31, 20X1. Therefore, it is a non-adjusting event. Beta Inc. would not adjust the amounts recognised in its 20X1 financial statements. However, because the event is material, Beta Inc. would disclose in the notes to its 20X1 financial statements the nature of the event (warehouse fire) and an estimate of the financial effect ($5 million loss), or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made if that were the case.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 10:**

IAS 10 provides a clear framework for how entities should treat events that occur after their reporting date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue. The critical distinction is whether the event provides evidence of conditions existing at the reporting date (adjusting) or conditions arising after that date (non-adjusting). This distinction dictates whether the financial statements themselves are adjusted or if disclosure in the notes is sufficient. The standard also highlights the importance of disclosures regarding the authorisation date and significant non-adjusting events to ensure users have relevant information for their decision-making.
