## IAS 21: The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates is to prescribe how to include foreign currency transactions and foreign operations in the financial statements of an entity and how to translate financial statements into a presentation currency. The principal issues are which exchange rate(s) to use and how to report the financial effects of changes in exchange rates in the financial statements.

**Scope:** IAS 21 applies to: (a) accounting for transactions and balances in foreign currencies, except for those derivative transactions and balances that are within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; (b) translating the results and financial position of foreign operations that are included in the financial statements of the entity by consolidation, proportionate consolidation or the equity method; and (c) translating an entity’s results and financial position into a presentation currency. IAS 21 does not apply to hedge accounting for foreign currency items, including the hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation (which is covered by IFRS 9).

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Functional Currency:** Each entity identifies its functional currency. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. It is the currency that mainly influences sales prices for goods and services and the currency of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sales prices of its goods and services. It also influences labour, material and other costs of providing goods or services. An entity considers several factors in determining its functional currency:
    *   The currency that mainly influences sales prices for goods and services.
    *   The currency of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sales prices of its goods and services.
    *   The currency that mainly influences labour, material and other costs of providing goods or services.
    *   The currency in which funds from financing activities (i.e., issuing debt and equity instruments) are generated.
    *   The currency in which receipts from operating activities are usually retained.
    Once determined, the functional currency is not changed unless there is a change in those underlying transactions, events and conditions.

2.  **Reporting Foreign Currency Transactions in the Functional Currency:**
    *   **Initial Recognition:** A foreign currency transaction is a transaction that is denominated or requires settlement in a foreign currency. On initial recognition, a foreign currency transaction shall be recorded, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.
    *   **Reporting at the ends of subsequent reporting periods:**
        *   Foreign currency monetary items (e.g., cash, receivables, payables) shall be translated using the closing rate (the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period).
        *   Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency (e.g., property, plant and equipment, inventory) shall be translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction (historical rate).
        *   Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency (e.g., equity investments measured at fair value) shall be translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
    *   **Recognition of Exchange Differences:** Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements shall be recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI), any exchange component of that gain or loss shall also be recognised in OCI. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss.

3.  **Translation of a Foreign Operation’s Financial Statements to the Presentation Currency:**
    *   The results and financial position of an entity whose functional currency is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are translated into a different presentation currency using the following procedures:
        *   Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (including comparatives) shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position.
        *   Income and expenses for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income (including comparatives) shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. For practical reasons, an average rate for the period is often used for all income and expense items, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly.
        *   All resulting exchange differences shall be recognised in other comprehensive income as a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA). These exchange differences are not recognised in profit or loss because the changes in exchange rates have little or no direct effect on the present and future cash flows from operations.
    *   Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they are expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
    *   On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the separate component of equity, shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

4.  **Hyperinflationary Economies:** Special rules apply for translating the financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy (covered by IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies).

**Disclosure:** An entity shall disclose:
*   The amount of exchange differences recognised in profit or loss (except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9).
*   Net exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity, and a reconciliation of the amount of such exchange differences at the beginning and end of the period.
*   When the presentation currency is different from the functional currency, that fact shall be stated, together with disclosure of the functional currency and the reason for using a different presentation currency.
*   When an entity changes its functional currency, the fact and reason for the change in functional currency shall be disclosed.

**Practical Example Scenario (Foreign Currency Transaction):**

UK Corp (functional currency GBP) purchases goods from a US supplier on December 1, 20X1, for USD 10,000. The exchange rate on this date is GBP 1 = USD 1.25 (or USD 1 = GBP 0.80).
*   **Initial Recognition:** UK Corp records the purchase and a trade payable of GBP 8,000 (USD 10,000 * 0.80).

At its year-end, December 31, 20X1, the payable is still outstanding. The exchange rate is now GBP 1 = USD 1.30 (or USD 1 = GBP 0.7692).
*   **Year-end retranslation of monetary item (payable):** The USD 10,000 payable is retranslated to GBP 7,692 (USD 10,000 * 0.7692).
*   **Exchange Gain:** UK Corp recognises an exchange gain of GBP 308 (GBP 8,000 - GBP 7,692) in profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 20X1, because the GBP equivalent of the liability has decreased.

On January 31, 20X2, UK Corp settles the payable. The exchange rate on this date is GBP 1 = USD 1.28 (or USD 1 = GBP 0.78125).
*   **Cash paid to settle:** USD 10,000, which costs UK Corp GBP 7,812.50 (USD 10,000 * 0.78125).
*   **Carrying amount of payable at settlement date (from Dec 31, 20X1):** GBP 7,692.
*   **Exchange Loss on settlement:** UK Corp recognises an exchange loss of GBP 120.50 (GBP 7,812.50 - GBP 7,692) in profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 20X2.

**Practical Example Scenario (Translation of Foreign Operation):**

Parent Co. (functional currency EUR) has a subsidiary, Sub Inc., located in the USA (functional currency USD). At the end of 20X1, Sub Inc.
's net assets are USD 1,000,000. The closing exchange rate is EUR 1 = USD 1.10. Sub Inc.
's profit for 20X1 was USD 150,000, and the average exchange rate for the year was EUR 1 = USD 1.15.

*   **Translation of Net Assets:** USD 1,000,000 / 1.10 = EUR 909,091.
*   **Translation of Profit:** USD 150,000 / 1.15 = EUR 130,435.

If the opening net assets translated at the opening rate, plus profit translated at the average rate, does not equal the closing net assets translated at the closing rate (after accounting for dividends, capital contributions etc.), the difference would be recognised as a cumulative translation adjustment in Parent Co.
's other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 21:**

IAS 21 is fundamental for entities engaging in foreign currency transactions or having foreign operations. The correct determination of the functional currency is a critical first step. The standard provides specific rules for translating foreign currency transactions and balances into the functional currency, and for translating the financial statements of foreign operations into the presentation currency of the reporting entity. Exchange differences arising from these translations are generally recognised in profit or loss for monetary items and transactions, while those arising from the translation of foreign operations are typically recognised in other comprehensive income. Proper application and disclosure under IAS 21 are essential for providing users with a clear understanding of an entity’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and their impact on financial performance and position.
