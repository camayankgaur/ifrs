## IAS 40: Investment Property

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 40 Investment Property is to prescribe the accounting treatment for investment property and related disclosure requirements. Investment property is property (land or a building—or part of a building—or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for: (a) use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or (b) sale in the ordinary course of business.

**Scope:** IAS 40 applies to the recognition, measurement and disclosure of investment property. It does not apply to: (a) biological assets related to agricultural activity (see IAS 41 Agriculture and IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment); and (b) mineral rights and mineral reserves such as oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. It also does not apply to property leased to another entity under a finance lease from the perspective of the lessor, or to property leased from another entity under an operating lease from the perspective of the lessee (IFRS 16 Leases covers these).

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Investment property:** Property (land or a building—or part of a building—or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for: (a) use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes (i.e., owner-occupied property, covered by IAS 16); or (b) sale in the ordinary course of business (i.e., inventory, covered by IAS 2).
*   **Owner-occupied property:** Property held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
*   **Fair value:** The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (see IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).
*   **Cost:** The amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of other consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the amount attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specific requirements of other IFRSs (e.g. IFRS 2 Share-based Payment).

**Examples of Investment Property:**
*   Land held for long-term capital appreciation rather than for short-term sale in the ordinary course of business.
*   Land held for a currently undetermined future use.
*   A building owned by the entity (or a right-of-use asset relating to a building held by the entity) and leased out under one or more operating leases.
*   A building that is vacant but is held to be leased out under one or more operating leases.
*   Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property.

**Examples of items that are NOT Investment Property:**
*   Property intended for sale in the ordinary course of business or in the process of construction or development for such sale (see IAS 2 Inventories).
*   Owner-occupied property (see IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment), including property held for future use as owner-occupied property, property held for future development and subsequent use as owner-occupied property, property occupied by employees (whether or not the employees pay rent at market rates) and owner-occupied property awaiting disposal.
*   Property that is leased to another entity under a finance lease.

**Key Principles - Recognition:**
Investment property shall be recognised as an asset when, and only when:
1.  It is **probable** that the future economic benefits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the entity; and
2.  The **cost** of the investment property can be measured reliably.

**Initial Measurement:** An investment property shall be measured initially at its cost. Transaction costs shall be included in the initial measurement. The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure (e.g., legal fees, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs). The cost of a self-constructed investment property is its cost at the date when the construction or development is complete.

**Measurement After Recognition:** An entity shall choose as its accounting policy either the fair value model or the cost model and shall apply that policy to all of its investment property.
*   **Fair Value Model:** After initial recognition, an entity that chooses the fair value model shall measure all of its investment property at fair value, except in the extremely rare cases where fair value cannot be reliably determined on a continuing basis. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property must be included in net profit or loss for the period in which it arises. Fair value is determined in accordance with IFRS 13. An entity is encouraged, but not required, to determine the fair value of investment property on the basis of a valuation by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.
    If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property (other than an investment property under construction) is not reliably determinable on a continuing basis, the entity shall measure that investment property using the cost model in IAS 16. The residual value of the investment property shall be assumed to be zero. The entity shall continue to measure other investment property at fair value.
*   **Cost Model:** After initial recognition, an entity that chooses the cost model shall measure all of its investment property in accordance with IAS 16’s requirements for that model (i.e., cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses), other than those that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or are included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with IFRS 5. Even if an entity uses the cost model, it is still required to disclose the fair value of its investment property.

**Transfers:** Transfers to, or from, investment property shall be made when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by:
*   Commencement of owner-occupation, for a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property.
*   Commencement of development with a view to sale, for a transfer from investment property to inventories.
*   End of owner-occupation, for a transfer from owner-occupied property to investment property.
*   Commencement of an operating lease to another party, for a transfer from inventories to investment property.
*   End of construction or development, for a transfer from property in the course of construction or development (covered by IAS 16) to investment property.

When an entity uses the cost model for investment property, transfers between categories (investment property, owner-occupied property, and inventories) do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred, and they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure purposes.
If an entity uses the fair value model:
*   For a transfer from investment property carried at fair value to owner-occupied property or inventories, the property’s deemed cost for subsequent accounting in accordance with IAS 16 or IAS 2 shall be its fair value at the date of change in use.
*   If an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property that will be carried at fair value, an entity shall apply IAS 16 up to the date of change in use. The entity shall treat any difference at that date between the carrying amount of the property in accordance with IAS 16 and its fair value in the same way as a revaluation in accordance with IAS 16 (i.e., increase to revaluation surplus in OCI, decrease to P&L unless reversing a previous surplus).
*   For a transfer from inventories to investment property that will be carried at fair value, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date and its previous carrying amount shall be recognised in profit or loss.
*   When an entity completes the construction or development of a self-constructed investment property that will be carried at fair value, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date and its previous carrying amount shall be recognised in profit or loss.

**Disposals:** An investment property shall be derecognised (eliminated from the statement of financial position) on disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposal. Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of investment property shall be determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and shall be recognised in profit or loss in the period of the retirement or disposal (unless IFRS 16 requires otherwise on a sale and leaseback).

**Disclosure:** Disclosures are extensive and include, among others:
*   Whether the entity applies the fair value model or the cost model.
*   If it applies the fair value model: a reconciliation of the carrying amount of investment property at the beginning and end of the period, showing additions, disposals, fair value adjustments, net exchange differences, transfers to/from inventories and owner-occupied property, and other changes. Also, significant assumptions used in determining fair value.
*   If it applies the cost model: the depreciation methods used, useful lives or depreciation rates, gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the period, a reconciliation of the carrying amount, and the fair value of investment property. Even if the cost model is used, the fair value must be disclosed.
*   The extent to which the fair value of investment property is based on a valuation by an independent valuer.
*   Amounts recognised in profit or loss for: rental income from investment property; direct operating expenses (including repairs and maintenance) arising from investment property that generated rental income and that did not generate rental income during the period.
*   The existence and amounts of restrictions on the realisability of investment property or the remittance of income and proceeds of disposal.
*   Contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment property or for repairs, maintenance or enhancements.

**Practical Example Scenario (Fair Value Model):**

Realty Co. owns a building that it leases out to tenants under operating leases. Realty Co. uses the fair value model for its investment properties.
*   On January 1, 20X1, the fair value of the building was $1,000,000.
*   During 20X1, Realty Co. received rental income of $120,000 and incurred direct operating expenses (repairs, insurance) of $30,000 related to this building.
*   On December 31, 20X1, the fair value of the building was assessed by an independent valuer at $1,050,000.

Accounting for 20X1:
*   Rental income of $120,000 recognised in profit or loss.
*   Operating expenses of $30,000 recognised in profit or loss.
*   Increase in fair value of $50,000 ($1,050,000 - $1,000,000) recognised in profit or loss.
*   The building is shown on the statement of financial position at $1,050,000 at December 31, 20X1.

**Practical Example Scenario (Cost Model with Fair Value Disclosure):**

PropCo owns a building held to earn rentals. PropCo uses the cost model for its investment properties.
*   Initial cost of building: $800,000. Useful life: 40 years. Residual value: $0. Straight-line depreciation.
*   Annual depreciation: $800,000 / 40 = $20,000.
*   At the end of Year 1, carrying amount = $800,000 - $20,000 = $780,000.
*   PropCo must also disclose the fair value of the investment property in the notes. Assume the fair value at the end of Year 1 is $850,000. This fair value is disclosed, but the carrying amount remains $780,000 in the statement of financial position, and no fair value gain is recognised in profit or loss.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 40:**

IAS 40 provides specific guidance for properties held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation. A key decision for entities is the choice between the fair value model (with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss) and the cost model (similar to IAS 16, but with mandatory fair value disclosure). The definition of investment property is crucial, distinguishing it from owner-occupied property (IAS 16) and inventory (IAS 2). Transfers between categories are only permitted when there is a change in use, and the accounting for such transfers depends on the measurement model used. Extensive disclosures are required under both models to provide users with relevant information about an entity’s investment properties.
