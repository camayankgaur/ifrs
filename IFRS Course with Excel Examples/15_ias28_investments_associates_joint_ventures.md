## IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures is to prescribe the accounting for investments in associates and to set out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

**Scope:** IAS 28 applies to all entities that are investors with joint control of, or significant influence over, an investee (associate or joint venture). It does not apply to investments in associates or joint ventures held by, or indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds when those investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. When such investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, the entity shall make the disclosures required by IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Associate:** An entity over which the investor has significant influence.
*   **Significant influence:** The power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. If an investor holds, directly or indirectly (e.g. through subsidiaries), 20% or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Conversely, if the investor holds, directly or indirectly, less than 20% of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the investor does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an investor from having significant influence.
The existence of significant influence is usually evidenced in one or more of the following ways: (a) representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; (b) participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions; (c) material transactions between the investor and its investee; (d) interchange of managerial personnel; or (e) provision of essential technical information.
*   **Joint venture:** A joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. (Refer to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements for joint control and joint arrangements).
*   **Equity method:** A method of accounting whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income.

**Key Principles - Application of the Equity Method:**

1.  **Initial Recognition:** An investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost.

2.  **Subsequent Measurement:** After initial recognition, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor’s share of the investee’s profit or loss is recognised in the investor’s profit or loss. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary for changes in the investor’s proportionate interest in the investee arising from changes in the investee’s other comprehensive income (e.g., those arising from revaluations of property, plant and equipment and from foreign currency translation differences). The investor’s share of those changes is recognised in the investor’s other comprehensive income.

3.  **Exemptions from applying the equity method:** An investor need not apply the equity method if the investor is a parent that is exempt from preparing consolidated financial statements by the scope exception in IFRS 10, or if all of the following apply:
    *   (a) The investor is a wholly-owned subsidiary, or is a partially-owned subsidiary of another entity and its other owners, including those not otherwise entitled to vote, have been informed about, and do not object to, the investor not applying the equity method.
    *   (b) The investor’s debt or equity instruments are not traded in a public market.
    *   (c) The investor did not file, nor is it in the process of filing, its financial statements with a securities commission or other regulatory organisation for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a public market.
    *   (d) The ultimate or any intermediate parent of the investor produces consolidated financial statements available for public use that comply with IFRSs.

4.  **Discontinuing the use of the equity method:** An entity shall discontinue the use of the equity method from the date when its investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture. This occurs when the investor loses significant influence or joint control. On losing significant influence or joint control, any retained interest in the former associate or joint venture is measured at fair value, and this fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition as a financial asset under IFRS 9. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate or joint venture is recognised in profit or loss.

5.  **Impairment Losses:** After application of the equity method, including recognising the associate’s or joint venture’s losses, the investor applies the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (or IFRS 9 for certain financial assets) to determine whether its investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is an indication of impairment, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment as a single asset, by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised is allocated to the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.

6.  **Transactions between an investor and its associate or joint venture (upstream and downstream transactions):** Gains and losses resulting from ‘upstream’ (from associate/joint venture to investor) and ‘downstream’ (from investor to associate/joint venture) transactions are recognised in the investor’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture. The investor’s share in the associate’s or joint venture’s gains or losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated.

7.  **Reporting dates:** The investor uses the financial statements of the associate or joint venture as of the same date as the financial statements of the investor unless it is impracticable to do so. If financial statements of an associate or a joint venture with a different reporting date are used, adjustments shall be made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between that date and the date of the investor’s financial statements. In any case, the difference between the end of the reporting period of the associate or joint venture and that of the investor shall be no more than three months.

**Disclosure:** The disclosures required are specified in IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. These include summarised financial information for associates and joint ventures that are material to the reporting entity, quantitative information about the aggregate carrying amount of its interests in all individually immaterial associates or joint ventures, the nature and extent of any significant restrictions on the ability of associates or joint ventures to transfer funds to the entity, and information about commitments relating to its joint ventures.

**Practical Example Scenario (Applying the Equity Method):**

Investor Corp acquires 30% of the ordinary shares of Associate Co. on January 1, 20X1, for $150,000. This shareholding gives Investor Corp significant influence over Associate Co.

*   **Initial Recognition:** Investment in Associate Co. is recorded at cost: $150,000.

During the year ended December 31, 20X1, Associate Co. reports the following:
*   Profit for the year: $60,000.
*   Other comprehensive income (revaluation surplus on PPE): $20,000.
*   Dividends paid: $10,000.

Investor Corp’s share of these amounts:
*   Share of profit: $60,000 * 30% = $18,000.
*   Share of OCI: $20,000 * 30% = $6,000.
*   Share of dividends received: $10,000 * 30% = $3,000.

Accounting by Investor Corp for 20X1:
*   Recognise share of profit in Investor Corp’s profit or loss: $18,000.
*   Recognise share of OCI in Investor Corp’s other comprehensive income: $6,000.
*   Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment: $3,000.

Calculation of the carrying amount of the investment at December 31, 20X1:
*   Initial cost: $150,000
*   Add: Share of profit: $18,000
*   Add: Share of OCI: $6,000
*   Less: Dividends received: ($3,000)
*   **Carrying amount at December 31, 20X1:** $150,000 + $18,000 + $6,000 - $3,000 = **$171,000**.

If, at year-end, there were indications that the investment in Associate Co. was impaired, Investor Corp would test the $171,000 carrying amount for impairment under IAS 36.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 28:**

IAS 28 mandates the use of the equity method for accounting for investments where an investor has significant influence (associates) or joint control with rights to net assets (joint ventures). The equity method reflects the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets and performance, providing a more representative picture of the investment’s contribution to the investor than cost or fair value accounting in many cases. The standard outlines the mechanics of applying the equity method, including initial recognition, subsequent adjustments for profits, losses, OCI, and dividends, and impairment testing. It also addresses specific issues like transactions between the investor and investee and differences in reporting dates. Disclosures, primarily governed by IFRS 12, are crucial for users to understand the nature and financial impact of these investments.
