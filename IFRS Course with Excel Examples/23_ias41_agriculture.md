## IAS 41: Agriculture

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 41 Agriculture is to prescribe the accounting treatment and disclosures related to agricultural activity. Agricultural activity is the management by an entity of the biological transformation and harvest of biological assets for sale or for conversion into agricultural produce or into additional biological assets.

**Scope:** IAS 41 applies to accounting for the following when they relate to agricultural activity: (a) biological assets, except for bearer plants; (b) agricultural produce at the point of harvest; and (c) government grants related to a biological asset measured at its fair value less costs to sell. IAS 41 does not apply to: (a) land related to agricultural activity (see IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Property); (b) bearer plants related to agricultural activity (see IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment). However, this Standard applies to the produce on those bearer plants; (c) government grants related to bearer plants (see IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance); (d) intangible assets related to agricultural activity (see IAS 38 Intangible Assets); and (e) right-of-use assets arising from a lease of land related to agricultural activity (see IFRS 16 Leases).

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Agricultural activity:** The management by an entity of the biological transformation and harvest of biological assets for sale, or for conversion into agricultural produce or into additional biological assets.
*   **Biological asset:** A living animal or plant.
*   **Agricultural produce:** The harvested product of the entity’s biological assets.
*   **Harvest:** The detachment of produce from a biological asset or the cessation of a biological asset’s life processes.
*   **Bearer plant:** A living plant that: (a) is used in the production or supply of agricultural produce; (b) is expected to bear produce for more than one period; and (c) has a remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural produce, except for incidental scrap sales. (Bearer plants are accounted for under IAS 16, but their produce is within IAS 41).
*   **Biological transformation:** Comprises the processes of growth, degeneration, production, and procreation that cause qualitative or quantitative changes in a biological asset.
*   **Costs to sell:** The incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income taxes.
*   **Fair value:** The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (see IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).

**Key Principles - Recognition and Measurement:**

1.  **Recognition:** An entity shall recognise a biological asset or agricultural produce when, and only when: (a) the entity controls the asset as a result of past events; (b) it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity; and (c) the fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

2.  **Measurement of Biological Assets:** A biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at its **fair value less costs to sell**, unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably.

3.  **Measurement of Agricultural Produce:** Agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological assets shall be measured at its **fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest**. Such measurement is the cost at that date when applying IAS 2 Inventories or another applicable Standard. Once harvested, agricultural produce becomes inventory and is accounted for under IAS 2.

4.  **Gains and Losses:** A gain or loss arising on initial recognition of a biological asset at fair value less costs to sell and from a change in fair value less costs to sell of a biological asset shall be included in profit or loss for the period in which it arises. A gain or loss arising on initial recognition of agricultural produce at fair value less costs to sell shall be included in profit or loss for the period in which it arises.

5.  **Inability to Measure Fair Value Reliably:** There is a presumption that fair value can be measured reliably for a biological asset. However, that presumption can be rebutted only on initial recognition for a biological asset for which quoted market prices are not available and for which alternative fair value measurements are determined to be clearly unreliable. In such a case, that biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Once the fair value of such a biological asset becomes reliably measurable, an entity shall measure it at its fair value less costs to sell. If a non-current biological asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or is included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with IFRS 5, it is presumed that fair value can be measured reliably.

6.  **Determining Fair Value:** IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement provides guidance. If an active market exists for a biological asset or agricultural produce, the quoted price in that market is the appropriate basis for determining the fair value of that asset. If an entity has access to different active markets, the entity uses the price existing in the market in which it expects to participate. If an active market does not exist, an entity uses one or more of the following, when available, in determining fair value: (a) the most recent market transaction price, provided that there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances between the date of that transaction and the end of the reporting period; (b) market prices for similar assets with adjustment to reflect differences; and (c) sector benchmarks such as the value of an orchard expressed per export tray, bushel, or hectare, and the value of cattle expressed per kilogram of meat. In some cases, a present value of expected net cash flows from the asset discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate may be used.

7.  **Costs to Sell:** Costs to sell include commissions to brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and commodity exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. Costs to sell exclude transport and other costs necessary to get assets to a market.

**Government Grants:** An unconditional government grant related to a biological asset measured at its fair value less costs to sell shall be recognised in profit or loss when, and only when, the government grant becomes receivable. If a government grant related to a biological asset measured at its fair value less costs to sell is conditional, including when a government grant requires an entity not to engage in some specified agricultural activity, an entity shall recognise the government grant in profit or loss when, and only when, the conditions attaching to the government grant are met.

**Disclosure:** Disclosures required by IAS 41 include:
*   The aggregate gain or loss arising during the current period on initial recognition of biological assets and agricultural produce and from the change in fair value less costs to sell of biological assets.
*   A description of each group of biological assets.
*   Quantitative information about each group of biological assets, distinguishing between consumable and bearer biological assets or between mature and immature biological assets, as appropriate. Consumable biological assets are those that are to be harvested as agricultural produce or sold as biological assets. Bearer biological assets are other than consumable biological assets; for example, livestock from which milk is produced.
*   The methods and significant assumptions applied in determining the fair value of each group of agricultural produce at the point of harvest and each group of biological assets.
*   The fair value less costs to sell of agricultural produce harvested during the period, determined at the point of harvest.
*   The existence and carrying amounts of biological assets whose title is restricted, and the carrying amounts of biological assets pledged as security for liabilities.
*   Commitments for the development or acquisition of biological assets.
*   Financial risk management strategies related to agricultural activity.
*   A reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of biological assets between the beginning and the end of the current period. The reconciliation shall include: (i) the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value less costs to sell; (ii) increases resulting from purchases; (iii) decreases attributable to sales and biological assets classified as held for sale; (iv) decreases resulting from harvest; (v) increases resulting from business combinations; (vi) net exchange differences arising on the translation of financial statements into a different presentation currency, and on the translation of a foreign operation into the presentation currency of the reporting entity; and (vii) other changes.
*   If fair value cannot be measured reliably, additional disclosures are required for those biological assets measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.

**Practical Example Scenario (Dairy Cattle):**

FarmCo owns a herd of 100 dairy cows. On January 1, 20X1, the fair value less costs to sell of the herd was $150,000.
During 20X1:
*   10 new calves were born. At birth, their fair value less costs to sell was $500 each (total $5,000).
*   Milk harvested during the year had a fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest of $60,000. This milk was subsequently sold for $65,000 (costs to sell after harvest and processing were $3,000).
*   5 older cows were sold for $4,000 (their fair value less costs to sell just before sale was $3,800).
*   Feeding and other operating costs for the herd were $25,000.
*   On December 31, 20X1, the fair value less costs to sell of the remaining 105 cows (100 - 5 + 10) was $170,000.

**Accounting Treatment & P&L Impact:**
1.  **Initial recognition of calves:** Gain of $5,000 recognised in P&L.
2.  **Milk harvested:** Recognised as inventory at $60,000 (fair value less costs to sell at harvest). A corresponding gain of $60,000 is recognised in P&L from agricultural activity. When sold, IAS 2 applies: Revenue $65,000, Cost of Sales $60,000 (plus any further processing costs if applicable, here assumed $3,000 are post-harvest selling costs not included in the $60,000 point-of-harvest valuation). So, profit on sale of milk might be $65,000 - $60,000 - $3,000 = $2,000, in addition to the $60,000 gain on initial recognition of agricultural produce.
3.  **Sale of cows:**
    *   Gain on re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell immediately before sale: $3,800 (FVLCS before sale) - Carrying Amount before this final re-measurement. (This is part of the overall change in FVLCS for the herd).
    *   Proceeds $4,000. Carrying amount at sale (FVLCS) $3,800. Gain on disposal $200 (this is often netted within the overall FVLCS change unless presented separately).
4.  **Change in fair value less costs to sell of the herd:**
    *   Opening FVLCS: $150,000
    *   Add: Calves born (initial recognition): $5,000
    *   Less: Cows sold (FVLCS at sale): ($3,800)
    *   Carrying amount before year-end re-measurement: $150,000 + $5,000 - $3,800 = $151,200.
    *   Closing FVLCS: $170,000.
    *   Gain from change in FVLCS (excluding initial recognition of calves and re-measurement of sold animals just before sale, which are often separately identified or part of this total): $170,000 - $151,200 = $18,800. This is recognised in P&L.
    *   Alternatively, the total gain from change in FVLCS for the year for biological assets is: Closing FVLCS ($170,000) - Opening FVLCS ($150,000) + FVLCS of sold assets ($3,800) - FVLCS of purchases (0) - FVLCS of newborns ($5,000) = $170,000 - $150,000 + $3,800 - $5,000 = $18,800. (This calculation can be structured in various ways in the reconciliation note).
5.  **Operating costs:** $25,000 expensed in P&L.

Total impact on P&L from agricultural activities (excluding profit on sale of milk after harvest, which is under IAS 2):
*   Gain on initial recognition of calves: $5,000
*   Gain on initial recognition of milk (agricultural produce): $60,000
*   Gain from change in FVLCS of dairy herd (including impact of sales): $18,800 (plus the $200 gain on disposal if separated)
*   Less operating costs: ($25,000)
*   Net gain in P&L related to agricultural activity: $5,000 + $60,000 + $18,800 - $25,000 = $58,800 (approx, depending on how the gain on sold cows is split).

**Key Takeaways for IAS 41:**

IAS 41 introduces a fair value accounting model for most biological assets and for agricultural produce at the point of harvest. This means that changes in fair value less costs to sell are recognised in profit or loss, which can lead to volatility in reported earnings. The standard distinguishes biological assets from bearer plants (which are under IAS 16) and agricultural produce (which becomes inventory under IAS 2 after harvest). Understanding the definitions of agricultural activity, biological assets, and agricultural produce is crucial for applying the standard correctly. Disclosures are aimed at providing insight into the entity’s agricultural activities and the methods used to determine fair value.
