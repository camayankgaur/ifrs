## IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards

**Objective:** IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards aims to ensure that an entity’s first IFRS financial statements, and its interim financial reports for part of the period covered by those financial statements, contain high-quality information. This information must be transparent for users and comparable over all periods presented. Furthermore, it should provide a suitable starting point for accounting under IFRS Standards and be generatable at a cost that does not exceed the benefits to users.

**Scope:** This standard applies when an entity adopts IFRS Standards for the first time. This adoption is signified by an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRS Standards in its financial statements. It is important to note that IFRS 1 applies to the first set of annual financial statements in which an entity adopts IFRS Standards, and to each interim financial report, if any, that it presents under IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting for part of the period covered by its first IFRS financial statements.

**Key Principles:**

IFRS 1 is built upon several core principles designed to facilitate a smooth and transparent transition to IFRS. A fundamental requirement is the **retrospective application** of IFRS Standards. This means that, in general, an entity must apply all IFRS Standards effective at the end of its first IFRS reporting period as if it had always applied them. This often involves restating prior period financial statements to comply with IFRS, ensuring comparability across periods.

However, to ease the burden of this retrospective application and to avoid impractical situations, IFRS 1 provides certain **mandatory exceptions and voluntary exemptions**. Mandatory exceptions are areas where retrospective application is prohibited, such as in the derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, hedge accounting, non-controlling interests, and classification and measurement of financial assets. Voluntary exemptions allow entities to choose not to apply certain requirements retrospectively in specific circumstances. These exemptions cover areas such as business combinations (an entity may elect not to restate past business combinations), share-based payment transactions, insurance contracts, fair value or revaluation as deemed cost for property, plant and equipment, investment property, or intangible assets, employee benefits, cumulative translation differences, investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, associates and joint ventures, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, compound financial instruments, designation of previously recognised financial instruments, fair value measurement of financial assets or financial liabilities at initial recognition, decommissioning liabilities included in the cost of property, plant and equipment, financial assets or intangible assets accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements, borrowing costs, and severe hyperinflation.

An entity must prepare and present an **opening IFRS statement of financial position** at the date of transition to IFRS. The date of transition is the beginning of the earliest period for which an entity presents full comparative information under IFRS Standards in its first IFRS financial statements. This opening statement serves as the starting point for its accounting under IFRS.

Finally, IFRS 1 mandates **extensive disclosures**. These disclosures are crucial for users of financial statements to understand the impact of the transition from the entity's previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to IFRS. The entity must explain how the transition affected its reported financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This includes reconciliations of equity reported under previous GAAP to equity under IFRS at the date of transition and at the end of the latest period presented in the entity’s most recent annual financial statements under previous GAAP. Reconciliations of total comprehensive income are also required.

**Practical Example Scenario:**

Consider a hypothetical company, Global Ventures Ltd., which has historically prepared its financial statements using its local national accounting standards. For its reporting period ending December 31, 20X3, Global Ventures Ltd. decides to adopt IFRS for the first time and will issue an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance. Its date of transition to IFRS will be January 1, 20X2, as it intends to present one year of comparative information.

In preparing its first IFRS financial statements, Global Ventures Ltd. will need to prepare an opening IFRS statement of financial position as at January 1, 20X2. This will involve identifying assets and liabilities that need to be recognised under IFRS but were not under its previous GAAP, and vice versa. For instance, certain intangible assets might now qualify for recognition, or provisions might need to be adjusted. It will also need to remeasure assets and liabilities recognised under its previous GAAP to their IFRS-compliant amounts. For example, property, plant, and equipment might have been carried at cost under local GAAP but could be measured at fair value as deemed cost upon transition under an available exemption in IFRS 1. All resulting adjustments from these recognitions, derecognitions, and remeasurements will be recognised directly in retained earnings (or another category of equity, if appropriate) at the date of transition to IFRS.

Furthermore, Global Ventures Ltd. will need to apply IFRS retrospectively to its 20X2 financial information to present comparative figures in its 20X3 financial statements. This means the 20X2 statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows will all be restated as if IFRS had always been applied. The company will carefully consider the available exemptions in IFRS 1. For example, if it had a business combination in 20X1, it might elect not to restate that business combination under IFRS 3.

Finally, in its 20X3 financial statements, Global Ventures Ltd. will provide detailed reconciliations explaining the material adjustments made to its equity and total comprehensive income due to the transition from its previous GAAP to IFRS for both January 1, 20X2, and December 31, 20X2. This transparency is key to helping investors understand the financial impact of adopting IFRS.

**Key Takeaways for IFRS 1:**

IFRS 1 is a critical standard for any entity embarking on the journey of IFRS adoption. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the first set of IFRS financial statements provides a high-quality and transparent basis for future financial reporting. While the general principle is retrospective application, the standard offers practical expedients in the form of exemptions and exceptions to make the transition manageable. Comprehensive disclosures are paramount to explain the effects of the transition to users of the financial statements, thereby maintaining their confidence and understanding.
