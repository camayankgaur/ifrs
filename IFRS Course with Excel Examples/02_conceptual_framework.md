### The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting

The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework) is a foundational document that underpins the development and application of IFRS Standards. It is not a standard itself and does not override any specific IFRS Standard. However, it provides the concepts that guide the IASB in developing and revising IFRS Standards and assists preparers in developing consistent accounting policies when no IFRS Standard applies to a particular transaction or event, or when a Standard allows a choice of accounting policy. It also helps all parties to understand and interpret the Standards.

The Conceptual Framework addresses several key areas, providing a coherent set of principles that ensure financial reporting is useful to investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. These decisions involve buying, selling, or holding equity and debt instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit.

#### Objectives of financial reporting

The primary objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. These decisions involve buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments, and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit. To achieve this objective, financial reports provide information about the entity’s economic resources and claims against the entity (its financial position), and the effects of transactions and other events that change those resources and claims (its financial performance).

#### Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information

For financial information to be useful, it must be relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to represent. These are the fundamental qualitative characteristics. Relevance means that the information is capable of making a difference in the decisions made by users. Faithful representation means that financial information represents economic phenomena in words and numbers. To be a perfectly faithful representation, a depiction would have three characteristics: it would be complete, neutral, and free from error. The usefulness of financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely, and understandable. These are enhancing qualitative characteristics. Comparability enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among, items. Verifiability helps assure users that information faithfully represents the economic phenomena it purports to represent. Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to be capable of influencing their decisions. Understandability means that information is classified, characterised, and presented clearly and concisely.

#### Financial statements and the reporting entity

Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial position and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Financial statements also show the results of the management’s stewardship of the resources entrusted to it. A reporting entity is an entity that is required, or chooses, to prepare financial statements. A reporting entity can be a single entity or a portion of an entity or can comprise more than one entity. The boundary of a reporting entity is determined by considering the information needs of the primary users of its financial statements.

#### The elements of financial statements

The elements of financial statements are the broad classes of the financial effects of transactions and other events. The elements directly related to the measurement of financial position in the statement of financial position are assets, liabilities, and equity. An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits. A liability is a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events. Equity is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities. The elements directly related to the measurement of financial performance in the statement(s) of financial performance are income and expenses. Income is increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims. Expenses are decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims.

#### Recognition and derecognition

Recognition is the process of capturing for inclusion in the statement of financial position or the statement(s) of financial performance an item that meets the definition of an element and satisfies the criteria for recognition. The recognition criteria are relevance and faithful representation. An item is recognised if its recognition provides users of financial statements with information that is useful, ie relevant information about the asset or the liability and about any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity, and it results in a faithful representation of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity. Derecognition is the removal of all or part of a recognised asset or liability from an entity’s statement of financial position. Derecognition normally occurs when that item no longer meets the definition of an asset or a liability.

#### Measurement

Measurement is the process of determining the monetary amounts at which the elements of the financial statements are to be recognised and carried in the statement of financial position and statement(s) of financial performance. The Conceptual Framework describes two categories of measurement bases: historical cost and current value. Historical cost measures provide monetary information about assets, liabilities, income and expenses using information derived, at least in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to them. Current value measures provide monetary information about assets, liabilities, income and expenses using information updated to reflect conditions at the measurement date. Current value measurement bases include fair value, value in use (for assets) and fulfilment value (for liabilities), and current cost.

#### Presentation and disclosure

Presentation and disclosure are the means by which information is communicated to users in financial statements. Effective communication of information in financial statements makes the information more relevant and contributes to a faithful representation of an entity’s assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. It also enhances the understandability and comparability of information in financial statements. The Conceptual Framework provides guidance on how to classify items for presentation, how to aggregate items, and what information to provide about them. Decisions about presentation and disclosure are based on the objectives of financial reporting and the qualitative characteristics of useful financial information.

#### Concepts of capital and capital maintenance

The Conceptual Framework describes two concepts of capital: a financial concept and a physical concept. The financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day. The selection of an appropriate concept of capital by an entity should be based on the needs of the users of its financial statements. The concept of capital maintenance is concerned with how an entity defines the capital that it seeks to maintain. It provides the linkage between the concepts of capital and the concepts of profit. Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power. Physical capital maintenance can only be measured in units of constant purchasing power.
