## IAS 20: Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance is to prescribe the accounting for, and disclosure of, government grants and other forms of government assistance. Government grants are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an entity in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity. Government assistance is action by government designed to provide an economic benefit specific to an entity or range of entities qualifying under certain criteria.

**Scope:** IAS 20 applies to accounting for and disclosure of government grants and disclosure of other forms of government assistance. It does not deal with: (a) the special problems arising in accounting for government grants in financial statements reflecting the effects of changing prices or in supplementary information of a similar nature; (b) government assistance that is provided for an entity in the form of benefits that are available in determining taxable profit or tax loss, or are determined or limited on the basis of income tax liability (e.g., income tax holidays, investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation allowances and reduced income tax rates); (c) government participation in the ownership of the entity; (d) government grants covered by IAS 41 Agriculture.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Recognition of Government Grants:**
    *   Government grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, shall not be recognised until there is reasonable assurance that: (a) the entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them; and (b) the grants will be received.
    *   The manner in which a grant is received does not affect the accounting method to be adopted in regard to the grant. Thus, a grant is accounted for in the same manner whether it is received in cash or as a reduction of a liability to the government.
    *   A forgivable loan from government is treated as a government grant when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will meet the terms for forgiveness of the loan.

2.  **Accounting Treatment of Government Grants:**
    *   Government grants shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. A government grant is not credited directly to shareholders’ interests.
    *   Two broad approaches to the accounting for government grants may be found: the capital approach, under which a grant is credited directly to equity, and the income approach, under which a grant is taken to income over one or more periods. IAS 20 requires the income approach.
    *   **Grants related to assets:** These are government grants whose primary condition is that an entity qualifying for them should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire long-term assets. Subsidiary conditions may also be attached restricting the type or location of the assets or the periods during which they are to be acquired or held. Grants related to assets are usually recognised in profit or loss over the periods and in the proportions in which depreciation expense on those assets is recognised. They are generally presented in the statement of financial position either by setting up the grant as deferred income, or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.
    *   **Grants related to income:** These are government grants other than those related to assets. They are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the entity recognises the related expense. Grants related to income are sometimes presented as a credit in the statement of profit or loss, either separately or under a general heading such as ‘Other income’; alternatively, they are deducted in reporting the related expense.

3.  **Repayment of Government Grants:**
    *   A government grant that becomes repayable shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate (see IAS 8). Repayment of a grant related to income shall be applied first against any unamortised deferred credit recognised in respect of the grant. To the extent that the repayment exceeds any such deferred credit, or when no deferred credit exists, the repayment shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss. Repayment of a grant related to an asset shall be recognised by increasing the carrying amount of the asset or reducing the deferred income balance by the amount repayable. The cumulative additional depreciation that would have been recognised in profit or loss to date in the absence of the grant shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.

4.  **Government Assistance:**
    *   Excluded from the definition of government grants are certain forms of government assistance which cannot reasonably have a value placed upon them and transactions with government which cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the entity. Examples of assistance that cannot reasonably have a value placed upon them are free technical or marketing advice and the provision of guarantees. An example of assistance that cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the entity is a government procurement policy that is responsible for a portion of the entity’s sales. The significance of the benefit in such cases may be such that disclosure of the nature, extent and duration of the assistance is necessary in order that the financial statements may not be misleading.

**Disclosure:** An entity shall disclose the following:
*   The accounting policy adopted for government grants, including the methods of presentation adopted in the financial statements.
*   The nature and extent of government grants recognised in the financial statements and an indication of other forms of government assistance from which the entity has directly benefited.
*   Unfulfilled conditions and other contingencies attaching to government assistance that has been recognised.

**Practical Example Scenario (Grant Related to Asset):**

EcoPower Ltd. receives a government grant of $100,000 on January 1, 20X1, to acquire a new piece of environmentally friendly machinery costing $500,000. The machinery has an estimated useful life of 10 years and will be depreciated on a straight-line basis with no residual value. EcoPower Ltd. has reasonable assurance it will meet the conditions of the grant and that the grant will be received (it was received on Jan 1, 20X1).

EcoPower Ltd. can choose one of two methods to account for the grant:

*   **Method 1: Deferred Income Approach**
    *   On January 1, 20X1, recognise the grant as deferred income: Debit Cash $100,000, Credit Deferred Grant Income $100,000.
    *   Each year, recognise a portion of the grant in profit or loss as income, matching the depreciation expense of the asset. Annual grant income = $100,000 / 10 years = $10,000.
    *   Annual depreciation expense = $500,000 / 10 years = $50,000.
    *   In the statement of profit or loss for 20X1: Depreciation Expense $50,000, Grant Income $10,000. Net impact on profit before tax related to this is an expense of $40,000.
    *   In the statement of financial position at December 31, 20X1: Machinery (net) $450,000 ($500k - $50k), Deferred Grant Income $90,000 ($100k - $10k).

*   **Method 2: Deduction from Asset Cost Approach**
    *   On January 1, 20X1, reduce the cost of the machinery by the grant amount: Net cost of machinery = $500,000 - $100,000 = $400,000.
    *   Annual depreciation expense = $400,000 / 10 years = $40,000.
    *   In the statement of profit or loss for 20X1: Depreciation Expense $40,000.
    *   In the statement of financial position at December 31, 20X1: Machinery (net) $360,000 ($400k - $40k).

Both methods result in the same net impact on profit or loss over the life of the asset.

**Practical Example Scenario (Grant Related to Income):**

Training Solutions Inc. receives a government grant of $20,000 to cover specific training expenses for its employees that it will incur in the current year. During the year, Training Solutions Inc. incurs and recognises $25,000 in eligible training expenses.

Training Solutions Inc. would recognise the $20,000 grant as income in the same period as the related training expenses are recognised. This could be presented as ‘Other income’ of $20,000, or as a reduction of the training expenses, resulting in a net training expense of $5,000 ($25,000 - $20,000) being reported.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 20:**

IAS 20 provides clear guidance on when and how to recognise government grants. The core principle is to match the grant income with the expenses it is intended to compensate, using a systematic basis. This income approach is mandatory. For grants related to assets, entities have a choice of presentation: either as deferred income or as a deduction from the asset's carrying amount. Repayment of grants is treated as a change in estimate. The standard also requires disclosure of the accounting policies for grants and the nature and extent of government assistance received, ensuring transparency for users of financial statements.
