## IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is to ensure that appropriate recognition criteria and measurement bases are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and that sufficient information is disclosed in the notes to enable users to understand their nature, timing and amount. The Standard aims to prevent the recognition of provisions that are not true obligations or the overstatement of liabilities, and to ensure that contingent items are appropriately disclosed.

**Scope:** IAS 37 applies to all entities in accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, except: (a) those resulting from executory contracts, unless the contract is onerous; (b) those covered by another IFRS (e.g., IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, IAS 12 Income Taxes, IAS 19 Employee Benefits, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, IFRS 16 Leases). Executory contracts are contracts under which neither party has performed any of its obligations or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Provision:** A liability of uncertain timing or amount.
*   **Liability:** A present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.
*   **Obligating event:** An event that creates a legal or constructive obligation that results in an entity having no realistic alternative to settling that obligation.
    *   **Legal obligation:** An obligation that derives from: (a) a contract (through its explicit or implicit terms); (b) legislation; or (c) other operation of law.
    *   **Constructive obligation:** An obligation that derives from an entity’s actions where: (a) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a sufficiently specific current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities; and (b) as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge those responsibilities.
*   **Contingent liability:** (a) A possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or (b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because: (i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or (ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
*   **Contingent asset:** A possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
*   **Onerous contract:** A contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.

**Key Principles - Recognition of Provisions:**
A provision shall be recognised when, and only when:
1.  An entity has a **present obligation** (legal or constructive) as a result of a **past event**;
2.  It is **probable** (i.e., more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and
3.  A **reliable estimate** can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If these conditions are not met, no provision shall be recognised.

**Measurement of Provisions:**
*   **Best estimate:** The amount recognised as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The best estimate is the amount an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time. Estimates of outcome and financial effect are determined by the judgement of the management of the entity, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts.
*   **Risks and uncertainties:** The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances shall be taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision. However, uncertainty does not justify the creation of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities.
*   **Present value:** Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) shall be a pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The discount rate(s) shall not reflect risks for which future cash flow estimates have been adjusted.
*   **Future events:** Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation shall be reflected in the amount of a provision where there is sufficient objective evidence that they will occur.
*   **Expected disposal of assets:** Gains from the expected disposal of assets shall not be taken into account in measuring a provision, even if the expected disposal is closely linked to the event giving rise to the provision.

**Reimbursements:** Where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party (e.g., through insurance claims, indemnity clauses or suppliers’ warranties), the reimbursement shall be recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation. The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset. The amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision. In the statement of comprehensive income, the expense relating to a provision may be presented net of the amount recognised for a reimbursement.

**Changes in Provisions:** Provisions shall be reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision shall be reversed.

**Use of Provisions:** A provision shall be used only for expenditures for which the provision was originally recognised.

**Specific Applications:**
*   **Future operating losses:** Provisions shall not be recognised for future operating losses.
*   **Onerous contracts:** If an entity has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a provision. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.
*   **Restructuring:** A provision for restructuring costs is recognised only when the general recognition criteria for provisions are met. A constructive obligation to restructure arises only when an entity: (a) has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying at least: the business or part of a business concerned; the principal locations affected; the location, function, and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services; the expenditures that will be undertaken; and when the plan will be implemented; and (b) has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. A restructuring provision shall include only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those that are both: (a) necessarily entailed by the restructuring; and (b) not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.

**Contingent Liabilities:** An entity shall not recognise a contingent liability. A contingent liability is disclosed, as required by paragraph 86, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. Where an entity is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability.

**Contingent Assets:** An entity shall not recognise a contingent asset. Contingent assets usually arise from unplanned or other unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of economic benefits to the entity. An example is a claim that an entity is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is uncertain. Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements because this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate. A contingent asset is disclosed, as required by paragraph 89, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

**Disclosure:** For each class of provision, an entity shall disclose: (a) the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period; (b) additional provisions made in the period, including increases to existing provisions; (c) amounts used (i.e. incurred and charged against the provision) during the period; (d) unused amounts reversed during the period; and (e) the increase during the period in the discounted amount arising from the passage of time and the effect of any change in the discount rate. Comparative information is not required.
An entity shall also disclose for each class of provision: (a) a brief description of the nature of the obligation and the expected timing of any resulting outflows of economic benefits; (b) an indication of the uncertainties about the amount or timing of those outflows; and (c) the amount of any expected reimbursement, stating the amount of any asset that has been recognised for that expected reimbursement.
Unless the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote, an entity shall disclose for each class of contingent liability at the end of the reporting period a brief description of the nature of the contingent liability and, where practicable: (a) an estimate of its financial effect; (b) an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of any outflow; and (c) the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where an inflow of economic benefits is probable, an entity shall disclose a brief description of the nature of the contingent assets at the end of the reporting period, and, where practicable, an estimate of their financial effect.
In extremely rare cases where disclosure of some or all of the information can be expected to prejudice seriously the position of the entity in a dispute with other parties on the subject matter of the provision, contingent liability or contingent asset, an entity need not disclose the information, but shall disclose the general nature of the dispute, together with the fact that, and reason why, the information has not been disclosed.

**Practical Example Scenario (Warranty Provision):**

Electro Ltd sells goods with a one-year warranty under which customers are covered for the cost of repairs of any manufacturing defects that become apparent within one year after purchase. Past experience indicates that 90% of goods sold will have no defects, 6% will have minor defects costing $50 each to repair, and 4% will have major defects costing $200 each to repair. In 20X1, Electro Ltd sold 10,000 units.

Expected cost of warranties:
*   (10,000 units * 6% * $50) = $3,000
*   (10,000 units * 4% * $200) = $80,000
*   Total expected warranty cost = $3,000 + $80,000 = $83,000.

Assuming it is probable that an outflow will be required and a reliable estimate can be made, Electro Ltd should recognise a provision for warranties of $83,000 at December 31, 20X1.

**Practical Example Scenario (Lawsuit - Contingent Liability vs. Provision):**

LegalCo is sued by a customer for $1,000,000 for alleged damages. LegalCo’s lawyers advise the following:
*   **Scenario A:** It is probable that LegalCo will lose the case and will have to pay an amount estimated reliably at $600,000. In this case, LegalCo has a present obligation, it is probable an outflow will occur, and a reliable estimate exists. LegalCo should recognise a provision for $600,000.
*   **Scenario B:** It is possible, but not probable, that LegalCo will lose the case. The potential loss is estimated at $600,000. In this case, LegalCo has a possible obligation (or a present obligation where outflow is not probable). LegalCo should not recognise a provision but should disclose a contingent liability of $600,000 (unless the probability of outflow is remote).
*   **Scenario C:** It is probable that LegalCo will win the case. No provision or contingent liability disclosure is needed (unless, very rarely, a present obligation exists but the amount cannot be reliably estimated, which would then be a disclosed contingent liability).

**Key Takeaways for IAS 37:**

IAS 37 provides a framework for identifying, measuring, and disclosing provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets. A key aspect is the strict criteria for recognising provisions: a present obligation from a past event, a probable outflow of resources, and a reliable estimate. This prevents premature or excessive provisioning. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised (unless virtually certain) but are disclosed if an inflow is probable. The standard aims to ensure that financial statements reflect an entity’s true obligations and potential risks and gains, enhancing transparency for users.
