## IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

**Objective:** The objective of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations is to specify the accounting for assets held for sale, and the presentation and disclosure of discontinued operations. Achieving this objective involves ensuring that assets to be disposed of are separately classified and measured, and that information about discontinued operations is clearly presented to users of financial statements, enabling them to evaluate the financial effects of such disposals.

**Scope:** IFRS 5 applies to all recognised non-current assets and to all disposal groups of an entity. A disposal group is a group of assets to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, together as a group in a single transaction, and liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The standard specifies that assets classified as non-current in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements shall not be reclassified as current assets until they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with this IFRS. Assets of a class that an entity would normally regard as non-current that are acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal are classified as current assets only if they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale under IFRS 5.

**Key Principles for Assets Held for Sale:**

1.  **Classification Criteria:** A non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, two conditions must be met:
    *   The asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups).
    *   The sale must be highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated. Furthermore, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. Additionally, the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification (subject to limited exceptions), and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

2.  **Measurement:** Once classified as held for sale, non-current assets (or disposal groups) are measured at the **lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell**. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset (or disposal group), excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
    *   **Depreciation/Amortisation Ceases:** Upon classification as held for sale, an entity ceases to depreciate or amortise the non-current asset (or assets within a disposal group).
    *   **Impairment:** If the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell is recognised as a gain, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognised either in accordance with IFRS 5 or previously in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

3.  **Presentation:** Assets classified as held for sale, and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale, are presented separately from other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position. These assets and liabilities are not offset and presented as a single amount. The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale must be separately disclosed either in the statement of financial position or in the notes.

**Key Principles for Discontinued Operations:**

1.  **Definition:** A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
    *   Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,
    *   Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or
    *   Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
    A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.

2.  **Presentation and Disclosure:** When an operation is classified as discontinued, IFRS 5 requires specific presentation and disclosures to help users understand the financial impact. An entity must disclose:
    *   A single amount in the statement of comprehensive income comprising the total of: (i) the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations and (ii) the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) constituting the discontinued operation.
    *   An analysis of this single amount into: (i) the revenue, expenses, and pre-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations; (ii) the related income tax expense; (iii) the gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) constituting the discontinued operation; and (iv) the related income tax expense. This analysis may be presented in the notes or in the statement of comprehensive income.
    *   The net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing, and financing activities of discontinued operations. This disclosure may be presented in the notes or in the financial statements.
    *   The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation classified as held for sale must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, unless disclosed on the face of the statement of financial position.
    Comparative information for prior periods presented in the financial statements must be re-presented to segregate the discontinued operation from continuing operations.

**Practical Example Scenario (Held for Sale):**

Manufacturing Co. decides on October 1, 20X1, to sell one of its factories. Management is committed to the plan, an active search for a buyer has begun, and the factory is being marketed at a reasonable price. The sale is expected within one year. As of October 1, 20X1, the factory has a carrying amount of $2,000,000 (Cost $5,000,000, Accumulated Depreciation $3,000,000). Its fair value is estimated at $1,800,000, and costs to sell are estimated at $50,000.

Upon classification as held for sale on October 1, 20X1:
*   Fair value less costs to sell = $1,800,000 - $50,000 = $1,750,000.
*   The factory will be measured at the lower of its carrying amount ($2,000,000) and fair value less costs to sell ($1,750,000). Thus, it will be measured at $1,750,000.
*   An impairment loss of $250,000 ($2,000,000 - $1,750,000) is recognised in profit or loss.
*   Depreciation on the factory ceases from October 1, 20X1.
*   In the statement of financial position at December 31, 20X1, the factory will be presented separately as an asset held for sale at $1,750,000.

**Practical Example Scenario (Discontinued Operation):**

Retail Group Inc. has several divisions. In 20X2, it decides to sell its entire electronics division, which represents a major line of business and has operations and cash flows clearly distinguishable from the rest of the group. The division is classified as held for sale from September 30, 20X2, and is sold on January 15, 20X3.

In its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 20X2, Retail Group Inc. will present the results of the electronics division as a discontinued operation. This means:
*   The statement of comprehensive income will show a single line item for the post-tax profit or loss from the discontinued electronics division (including any impairment to fair value less costs to sell).
*   Notes to the financial statements (or the face of the statement of comprehensive income) will provide an analysis of this amount, showing revenue, expenses, pre-tax profit/loss, and tax for the electronics division for the period it was part of the group and not yet sold.
*   Cash flows from the electronics division will be separately disclosed.
*   Comparative information for 20X1 will be restated to show the electronics division as a discontinued operation for that period as well, allowing for like-for-like comparison of continuing operations.

**Key Takeaways for IFRS 5:**

IFRS 5 provides specific guidance on accounting for non-current assets (and disposal groups) that are intended for sale, ensuring they are appropriately measured and presented. It also mandates clear presentation and disclosure for discontinued operations, which helps users assess the ongoing performance and prospects of an entity by separating out the effects of operations that have been or are in the process of being disposed of. The classification criteria for held for sale are strict, and the measurement at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell can lead to impairment charges. For discontinued operations, the re-presentation of comparatives is a key feature for user understanding.
