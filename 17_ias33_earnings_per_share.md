## IAS 33: Earnings per Share

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 33 Earnings per Share is to prescribe principles for the determination and presentation of earnings per share (EPS), so as to improve performance comparisons between different entities in the same reporting period and between different reporting periods for the same entity. Although EPS data has limitations because of the different accounting policies that may be used for determining ‘earnings’, a consistently determined denominator enhances financial reporting.

**Scope:** IAS 33 applies to entities whose ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares are publicly traded and to entities that are in the process of issuing ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares in public markets. An entity that discloses EPS shall calculate and disclose EPS in accordance with this Standard. When an entity presents both consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements, respectively, the disclosures required by this Standard need be presented only on the basis of the consolidated information.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Earnings:** Profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if applicable, profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those equity holders.
*   **Ordinary share:** An equity instrument that is subordinate to all other classes of equity instruments.
*   **Potential ordinary share:** A financial instrument or other contract that may entitle its holder to ordinary shares. Examples include: (a) financial liabilities or equity instruments, including preference shares, that are convertible into ordinary shares; (b) options and warrants; (c) shares that would be issued upon the satisfaction of conditions resulting from contractual arrangements, such as the purchase of a business or other assets.
*   **Dilution:** A reduction in earnings per share or an increase in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.
*   **Antidilution:** An increase in earnings per share or a reduction in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.

**Key Principles - Measurement:**

1.  **Basic Earnings Per Share (Basic EPS):** An entity shall calculate basic EPS amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if presented, profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those equity holders.
    Basic EPS shall be calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity (the numerator) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period.
    *   **Numerator (Earnings):** For the purpose of calculating basic EPS, the amounts attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity in respect of: (a) profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity; and (b) profit or loss attributable to the parent entity shall be the amounts in (a) and (b) adjusted for the after-tax amounts of preference dividends, differences arising on the settlement of preference shares, and other similar effects of preference shares classified as equity.
    *   **Denominator (Shares):** For the purpose of calculating basic EPS, the number of ordinary shares shall be the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, adjusted by the number of ordinary shares bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time-weighting factor. Shares are usually included in the weighted average number of shares from the date consideration is receivable (which is generally the date of their issue).
        Adjustments to the weighted average number of shares are required for events, other than the conversion of potential ordinary shares, that have changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources (e.g., a bonus issue, a share split, or a reverse share split). Such events are treated as if they had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

2.  **Diluted Earnings Per Share (Diluted EPS):** An entity shall calculate diluted EPS amounts for profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if presented, profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those equity holders.
    For the purpose of calculating diluted EPS, an entity shall adjust profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity, and the weighted average number of shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
    *   **Numerator (Earnings - Adjusted):** The profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity is adjusted by the after-tax effect of: (i) any dividends or other items related to dilutive potential ordinary shares deducted in arriving at profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity as calculated for basic EPS; (ii) any interest recognised in the period related to dilutive potential ordinary shares; and (iii) any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
    *   **Denominator (Shares - Adjusted):** The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased by the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease EPS or increase loss per share from continuing operations. The entity uses profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent entity as the control number to establish whether potential ordinary shares are dilutive or antidilutive.
    *   **Order of considering potential ordinary shares:** Potential ordinary shares shall be considered in sequence from the most dilutive to the least dilutive. For options and other share purchase arrangements, the ‘treasury stock method’ (or ‘treasury share method’ in IFRS terminology) is used to determine the number of incremental shares. This method assumes that any proceeds from the exercise of options would be used to repurchase ordinary shares at the average market price during the period.
    *   **Antidilutive potential ordinary shares** are ignored in calculating diluted EPS.

**Presentation:** An entity shall present basic and diluted EPS on the face of the statement of comprehensive income (or in the income statement, if presented separately) for profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and for profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity for the period for each class of ordinary shares that has a different right to share in profit for the period. An entity shall present basic and diluted EPS with equal prominence for all periods presented.
If an entity reports a discontinued operation, it shall disclose the basic and diluted amounts per share for the discontinued operation either on the face of the statement of comprehensive income (or income statement) or in the notes.

**Disclosure:** An entity shall disclose:
*   The amounts used as the numerators in calculating basic and diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of those amounts to profit or loss attributable to the parent entity for the period.
*   The weighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating basic and diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of these denominators to each other.
*   Instruments (including contingently issuable shares) that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future but were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS because they are antidilutive for the period(s) presented.
*   A description of ordinary share transactions or potential ordinary share transactions, other than those accounted for retrospectively, that occur after the reporting period and would have changed significantly the number of ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the period if those transactions had occurred before the end of the reporting period.

**Practical Example Scenario (Basic and Diluted EPS):**

Global Corp has profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of $1,200,000 for the year 20X1. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year was 500,000.

*   **Basic EPS:** $1,200,000 / 500,000 shares = $2.40 per share.

Global Corp also has the following potential ordinary shares:
*   **Convertible Bonds:** $200,000 of 5% convertible bonds, convertible into 40,000 ordinary shares. The interest expense on these bonds for the year was $10,000 (pre-tax). The tax rate is 30%.
    *   After-tax interest saving if converted: $10,000 * (1 - 0.30) = $7,000.
    *   Incremental shares: 40,000.
    *   EPS effect: $7,000 / 40,000 shares = $0.175 per share. Since this ($0.175) is less than basic EPS ($2.40), these bonds are dilutive.

*   **Share Options:** 60,000 share options with an exercise price of $15 per share. The average market price of ordinary shares during the year was $20 per share.
    *   Proceeds if options exercised: 60,000 options * $15 = $900,000.
    *   Number of shares assumed repurchased with proceeds (treasury stock method): $900,000 / $20 (average market price) = 45,000 shares.
    *   Incremental shares issued: 60,000 options - 45,000 shares repurchased = 15,000 shares.
    *   These 15,000 shares are added to the denominator with no adjustment to the numerator (as options don’t affect profit until exercised, and the treasury stock method assumes proceeds are used to buy back shares, not generate income).

**Calculation of Diluted EPS:**

1.  **Consider Convertible Bonds (most dilutive if multiple, here only one type of convertible):**
    *   Adjusted Earnings: $1,200,000 (basic earnings) + $7,000 (after-tax interest saving) = $1,207,000.
    *   Adjusted Shares: 500,000 (basic shares) + 40,000 (shares from bond conversion) = 540,000 shares.
    *   EPS with bonds converted: $1,207,000 / 540,000 = $2.235 per share. This is lower than basic EPS ($2.40), so the bonds are dilutive.

2.  **Consider Share Options (next, using earnings and shares from the previous step if that was dilutive):**
    *   Adjusted Earnings (from step 1): $1,207,000 (no further earnings impact from options under treasury stock method).
    *   Adjusted Shares (from step 1, plus option shares): 540,000 + 15,000 (incremental shares from options) = 555,000 shares.
    *   **Diluted EPS:** $1,207,000 / 555,000 shares = **$2.175 per share**.

Since $2.175 is less than $2.235 (and $2.40), both potential ordinary shares were dilutive when considered in order.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 33:**

IAS 33 provides a standardized method for calculating and presenting earnings per share, a widely used performance metric. It requires the calculation of both basic EPS (based on actual weighted average shares outstanding) and diluted EPS (reflecting the potential impact of all dilutive potential ordinary shares). The calculation of diluted EPS can be complex, involving adjustments to both earnings and the number of shares, and requires careful consideration of the dilutive effect of instruments like convertible bonds, options, and warrants. The standard aims to enhance comparability by ensuring a consistent approach to these calculations and requiring clear presentation and disclosure.
