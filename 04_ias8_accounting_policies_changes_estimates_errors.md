## IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors is to prescribe the criteria for selecting and changing accounting policies, together with the accounting treatment and disclosure of changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and corrections of prior period errors. The Standard is intended to enhance the relevance and reliability of an entity’s financial statements, and the comparability of those financial statements over time and with the financial statements of other entities.

**Scope:** IAS 8 applies in selecting and applying accounting policies, and accounting for changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and corrections of prior period errors. The tax effects of corrections of prior period errors and of retrospective adjustments made to apply changes in accounting policies are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Selection and Application of Accounting Policies:**
    *   When a specific IFRS applies to a transaction, other event or condition, the accounting policy or policies applied to that item shall be determined by applying that IFRS.
    *   In the absence of an IFRS that specifically applies to a transaction, other event or condition, management shall use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is:
        *   (a) relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users; and
        *   (b) reliable, in that the financial statements: (i) represent faithfully the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity; (ii) reflect the economic substance of transactions, other events and conditions, and not merely the legal form; (iii) are neutral, ie free from bias; (iv) are prudent; and (v) are complete in all material respects.
    *   In making this judgement, management shall refer to, and consider the applicability of, the following sources in descending order: (a) the requirements in IFRSs dealing with similar and related issues; and (b) the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. Management may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards, other accounting literature and accepted industry practices, to the extent that these do not conflict with the sources above.
    *   **Consistency of Accounting Policies:** An entity shall select and apply its accounting policies consistently for similar transactions, other events and conditions, unless an IFRS specifically requires or permits categorisation of items for which different policies may be appropriate.

2.  **Changes in Accounting Policies:**
    *   An entity shall change an accounting policy only if the change: (a) is required by an IFRS; or (b) results in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions, other events or conditions on the entity’s financial position, financial performance or cash flows.
    *   **Applying changes in accounting policies:**
        *   **Transitional provisions in an IFRS:** If a change in accounting policy is due to the initial application of an IFRS, it is accounted for in accordance with the specific transitional provisions, if any, in that IFRS.
        *   **No transitional provisions or voluntary change:** If an IFRS has no specific transitional provisions, or if the change is voluntary, the change shall be applied **retrospectively**. Retrospective application means applying a new accounting policy to transactions, other events and conditions as if that policy had always been applied. This involves adjusting the opening balance of each affected component of equity for the earliest prior period presented and the other comparative amounts disclosed for each prior period presented as if the new accounting policy had always been applied.
        *   **Limitations on retrospective application:** Retrospective application is required unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. When retrospective application is impracticable for a particular prior period, the new accounting policy is applied to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable, which may be the current period, and a corresponding adjustment is made to the opening balance of each affected component of equity for that period. If it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect, at the beginning of the current period, of applying a new accounting policy to all prior periods, the entity shall adjust the comparative information to apply the new accounting policy prospectively from the earliest date practicable.
    *   **Disclosure:** Extensive disclosures are required for changes in accounting policies, including the title of the IFRS, the nature of the change, a description of transitional provisions, and the amounts of adjustments for the current period and each prior period presented.

3.  **Changes in Accounting Estimates:**
    *   Many items in financial statements cannot be measured with precision but can only be estimated. The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial statements and does not undermine their reliability. Examples include bad debts, inventory obsolescence, or the useful life of an asset.
    *   A change in accounting estimate is an adjustment of the carrying amount of an asset or a liability, or the amount of the periodic consumption of an asset, that results from the assessment of the present status of, and expected future benefits and obligations associated with, assets and liabilities. Changes in accounting estimates result from new information or new developments and, accordingly, are not corrections of errors.
    *   The effect of a change in an accounting estimate shall be recognised **prospectively** by including it in profit or loss in: (a) the period of the change, if the change affects that period only; or (b) the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
    *   To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, it shall be recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability or equity item in the period of the change.
    *   **Disclosure:** An entity shall disclose the nature and amount of a change in an accounting estimate that has an effect in the current period or is expected to have an effect in future periods. If the effect on future periods is not disclosed because estimating it is impracticable, an entity shall disclose that fact.

4.  **Prior Period Errors:**
    *   Prior period errors are omissions from, and misstatements in, the entity’s financial statements for one or more prior periods arising from a failure to use, or misuse of, reliable information that: (a) was available when financial statements for those periods were authorised for issue; and (b) could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and taken into account in the preparation and presentation of those financial statements. Such errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.
    *   Material prior period errors shall be corrected **retrospectively** in the first set of financial statements authorised for issue after their discovery by: (a) restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or (b) if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest prior period presented.
    *   **Limitations on retrospective restatement:** Similar to changes in accounting policies, retrospective restatement is required unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the error.
    *   **Disclosure:** An entity shall disclose the nature of the prior period error, the amount of the correction for each financial statement line item affected for each prior period presented, the amount of the correction at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented, and if retrospective restatement is impracticable, the circumstances that led to the existence of that condition and a description of how and from when the error has been corrected.

**Practical Example Scenario (Change in Accounting Estimate):**

Tech Corp purchased a machine on January 1, 20X1, for $100,000. It estimated a useful life of 10 years and a residual value of $0. It uses the straight-line method of depreciation. So, annual depreciation was $10,000 ($100,000 / 10 years).
On January 1, 20X4 (after 3 years of depreciation), management revises its estimate of the machine’s total useful life from 10 years to 7 years due to new information about technological advancements. The residual value estimate remains $0.

*   **Carrying amount at Jan 1, 20X4:** $100,000 - (3 years * $10,000/year) = $70,000.
*   **Remaining useful life from Jan 1, 20X4:** 7 years (total) - 3 years (already passed) = 4 years.
*   **New annual depreciation from 20X4 onwards:** $70,000 / 4 years = $17,500.

This change in estimate is applied prospectively. The depreciation expense for 20X4 and subsequent years will be $17,500. No adjustments are made to prior years’ financial statements.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 8:**

IAS 8 is crucial for maintaining the consistency and comparability of financial statements. It clearly distinguishes between changes in accounting policies (generally applied retrospectively), changes in accounting estimates (applied prospectively), and corrections of prior period errors (applied retrospectively). Understanding these distinctions and their accounting treatments is essential for accurate financial reporting. The standard also emphasizes the importance of judgement in selecting accounting policies when no specific IFRS applies and mandates detailed disclosures to help users understand the impact of any changes or corrections.
