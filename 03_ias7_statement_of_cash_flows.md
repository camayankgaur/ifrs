## IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows is to require the provision of information about the historical changes in cash and cash equivalents of an entity by means of a statement of cash flows. This statement classifies cash flows during the period from operating, investing, and financing activities. Information about an entity’s cash flows helps users to assess the entity’s ability to generate cash and cash equivalents and the entity’s needs to utilise those cash flows.

**Scope:** IAS 7 applies to all entities in the preparation and presentation of their statements of cash flows. Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand and demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of an entity’s cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.

**Key Principles and Presentation of the Statement of Cash Flows:**

The statement of cash flows reports cash flows during the period classified by operating, investing, and financing activities.

1.  **Operating Activities:** These are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of profit or loss. Examples include:
    *   Cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services.
    *   Cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions, and other revenue.
    *   Cash payments to suppliers for goods and services.
    *   Cash payments to and on behalf of employees.
    *   Cash receipts and payments of an insurance entity for premiums and claims, annuities and other policy benefits.
    *   Cash payments or refunds of income taxes unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities.
    *   Cash receipts and payments from contracts held for dealing or trading purposes.
    Entities are encouraged to report cash flows from operating activities using the **direct method**, which discloses major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments. Alternatively, the **indirect method** may be used, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.

2.  **Investing Activities:** These are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. Investing activities represent the extent to which expenditures have been made for resources intended to generate future income and cash flows. Examples include:
    *   Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment, intangibles, and other long-term assets.
    *   Cash receipts from sales of property, plant and equipment, intangibles, and other long-term assets.
    *   Cash payments to acquire equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (other than payments for those instruments considered to be cash equivalents or those held for dealing or trading purposes).
    *   Cash receipts from sales of equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures (other than receipts for those instruments considered to be cash equivalents and those held for dealing or trading purposes).
    *   Cash advances and loans made to other parties (other than advances and loans made by a financial institution).
    *   Cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other parties (other than advances and loans of a financial institution).

3.  **Financing Activities:** These are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity. Financing activities help predict claims on future cash flows by providers of capital to the entity. Examples include:
    *   Cash proceeds from issuing shares or other equity instruments.
    *   Cash payments to owners to acquire or redeem the entity’s shares.
    *   Cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages, and other short-term or long-term borrowings.
    *   Cash repayments of amounts borrowed.
    *   Cash payments by a lessee for the reduction of the outstanding liability relating to a lease.

**Reporting Cash Flows on a Net Basis:**
Cash flows arising from operating, investing, or financing activities may be reported on a net basis for:
*   Cash receipts and payments on behalf of customers when the cash flows reflect the activities of the customer rather than those of the entity (e.g., acceptance and repayment of demand deposits by a bank).
*   Cash receipts and payments for items in which the turnover is quick, the amounts are large, and the maturities are short (e.g., advances made for, and repayment of, credit card customers).

**Foreign Currency Cash Flows:**
Cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency shall be recorded in an entity’s functional currency by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the cash flow. Cash flows of a foreign subsidiary should be translated at the exchange rates between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the dates of the cash flows. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not cash flows. However, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign currency is reported in the statement of cash flows in order to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the period. This amount is presented separately from cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

**Interest and Dividends:**
Cash flows from interest and dividends received and paid shall each be disclosed separately. Each shall be classified in a consistent manner from period to period as either operating, investing or financing activities. For a financial institution, interest paid and interest and dividends received are usually classified as operating cash flows. For other entities, there is no consensus on the classification of interest paid and interest and dividends received. Interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as operating cash flows because they enter into the determination of profit or loss. Alternatively, interest paid may be classified as financing cash flows and interest and dividends received may be classified as investing cash flows because they are costs of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments.
Dividends paid may be classified as a financing cash flow because they are a cost of obtaining financial resources. Alternatively, dividends paid may be classified as a component of cash flows from operating activities in order to assist users to determine the ability of an entity to pay dividends out of operating cash flows.

**Income Taxes:**
Cash flows arising from income taxes shall be separately disclosed and shall be classified as cash flows from operating activities unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities.

**Non-cash Transactions:**
Investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents shall be excluded from a statement of cash flows. Such transactions shall be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provides all the relevant information about these investing and financing activities (e.g., acquisition of assets by assuming directly related liabilities or by means of a finance lease; conversion of debt to equity).

**Disclosures:**
An entity shall disclose the components of cash and cash equivalents and shall present a reconciliation of the amounts in its statement of cash flows with the equivalent items reported in the statement of financial position. An entity shall disclose, together with a commentary by management, the amount of significant cash and cash equivalent balances held by the entity that are not available for use by the group.

**Practical Example Scenario:**

Consider Services Ltd. during the year 20X1. Its profit before tax was $150,000. Depreciation for the year was $20,000. Trade receivables increased by $10,000 and trade payables increased by $5,000. The company purchased new equipment for $50,000 cash and repaid a loan of $30,000. It also issued new shares for $40,000 cash.

Using the indirect method for operating activities:
*   **Profit before tax:** $150,000
*   **Adjustment for non-cash item (Depreciation):** + $20,000
*   **Adjustment for changes in working capital:**
    *   Increase in receivables (outflow): - $10,000
    *   Increase in payables (inflow): + $5,000
*   **Cash generated from operations (assuming no tax paid in cash shown here):** $150,000 + $20,000 - $10,000 + $5,000 = $165,000 (This would be further adjusted for tax paid)

Investing Activities:
*   **Purchase of equipment (outflow):** - $50,000

Financing Activities:
*   **Proceeds from issuance of shares (inflow):** + $40,000
*   **Repayment of loan (outflow):** - $30,000
*   **Net cash from financing activities:** $10,000

This simplified example shows how transactions are classified. A full statement of cash flows would also include the opening and closing cash and cash equivalent balances and a reconciliation.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 7:**

IAS 7 is vital for understanding an entity’s liquidity and solvency. It provides a clear picture of how an entity generates and uses cash. The classification into operating, investing, and financing activities helps users assess the impact of these different types of activities on the entity’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations and pursue opportunities. The choice between the direct and indirect method for operating activities affects the presentation detail, but both should arrive at the same net cash flow from operating activities.
