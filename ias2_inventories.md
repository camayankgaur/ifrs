## IAS 2: Inventories

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 2 is to prescribe the accounting treatment for inventories. A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount of cost to be recognised as an asset and carried forward until the related revenues are recognised. This Standard provides guidance on the determination of cost and its subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to net realisable value. It also provides guidance on the cost formulas that are used to assign costs to inventories.

**Scope:** IAS 2 applies to all inventories, except:

*   work in progress arising under construction contracts, including directly related service contracts (covered by IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers);
*   financial instruments (covered by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments);
*   biological assets related to agricultural activity and agricultural produce at the point of harvest (covered by IAS 41 Agriculture).

**Key Principles:**

*   **Measurement:** Inventories shall be measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV).
*   **Cost of Inventories:** The cost of inventories shall comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
    *   **Costs of purchase** comprise the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the entity from the taxing authorities), and transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of finished goods, materials and services. Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase.
    *   **Costs of conversion** include costs directly related to the units of production, such as direct labour. They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are those indirect costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of the volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory buildings and equipment, and the cost of factory management and administration. Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of production that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production, such as indirect materials and indirect labour.
    *   **Other costs** are included in the cost of inventories only to the extent that they are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. For example, it may be appropriate to include non-production overheads or the costs of designing products for specific customer orders in the cost of inventories.
*   **Cost Formulas:** The cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects shall be assigned by using specific identification of their individual costs. For other inventories, the cost shall be assigned by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted-average cost formula. An entity shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity. For inventories with a different nature or use, different cost formulas may be justified.
*   **Net Realisable Value (NRV):** NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Estimates of NRV also take into consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held. For example, the NRV of the quantity of inventory held to satisfy firm sales or service contracts is based on the contract price. If the sales contracts are for less than the inventory quantities held, the NRV of the excess is based on general selling prices.
*   **Recognition as an Expense:** When inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventories shall be recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories, arising from an increase in net realisable value, shall be recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.

**Disclosures:**

The financial statements shall disclose:

*   the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the cost formula used;
*   the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications appropriate to the entity;
*   the carrying amount of inventories carried at fair value less costs to sell;
*   the amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the period;
*   the amount of any write-down of inventories recognised as an expense in the period;
*   the amount of any reversal of any write-down that is recognised as income in the statement of comprehensive income;
*   the circumstances or events that led to the reversal of a write-down of inventories;
*   the carrying amount of inventories pledged as security for liabilities.

**Example:**

Company A buys raw materials for $100. It incurs $20 in labor costs and $10 in overhead to convert these raw materials into finished goods. The finished goods are expected to sell for $150. However, due to a sudden market downturn, the selling price drops to $120. The costs to sell (e.g., shipping, marketing) are estimated at $5 per unit.

*   **Cost of Inventory:** $100 (raw materials) + $20 (labor) + $10 (overhead) = $130
*   **Net Realisable Value (NRV):** $120 (selling price) - $5 (costs to sell) = $115
*   **Valuation:** Since NRV ($115) is lower than cost ($130), the inventory must be written down by $15 per unit. The inventory will be reported at $115 on the balance sheet.
*   **Expense Recognition:** When the inventory is sold, the cost of goods sold will be $115. The $15 write-down is also recognized as an expense in the period it occurs.

This example illustrates how IAS 2 ensures that inventories are not overstated on the balance sheet and that expenses are recognized in the appropriate period.
