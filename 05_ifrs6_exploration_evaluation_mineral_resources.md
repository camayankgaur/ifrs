## IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources

**Objective:** The objective of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources is to specify the financial reporting for the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources. Mineral resources include minerals, oil, natural gas, and similar non-regenerative resources. This standard aims to provide specific guidance on accounting for expenditures incurred by an entity in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of these resources, an area that had diverse accounting practices prior to IFRS 6.

**Scope:** IFRS 6 applies to exploration and evaluation expenditures that an entity incurs. It does not address other aspects of accounting by entities engaged in the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, such as the accounting for expenditures incurred before an entity obtains the legal rights to explore a specific area, or expenditures incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. Those expenditures are accounted for under other relevant IFRS Standards (e.g., IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, or IAS 38 Intangible Assets).

**Key Principles:**

IFRS 6 provides a temporary exemption from some of the requirements of other IFRS Standards, particularly IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, regarding the selection and application of accounting policies for exploration and evaluation expenditures. This allows entities to continue using their existing accounting policies for these expenditures, provided those policies meet certain minimum criteria.

1.  **Recognition and Measurement of Exploration and Evaluation Assets:**
    *   **Accounting Policy Choice:** IFRS 6 permits an entity to develop an accounting policy for allocating exploration and evaluation expenditures to exploration and evaluation assets. These assets are measured at cost at recognition.
    *   **Elements of Cost:** An entity determines which expenditures are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets in accordance with its accounting policy. Examples of expenditures that might be included are costs of: acquiring rights to explore; topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies; exploratory drilling; trenching; sampling; and activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource. Expenditures related to the development of mineral resources are not exploration and evaluation expenditures and are accounted for under other standards once technical feasibility and commercial viability are demonstrable.
    *   **Changes in Accounting Policies:** An entity may change its accounting policies for exploration and evaluation expenditures if the change makes the financial statements more relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users and no less reliable, or more reliable and no less relevant to those needs. The entity judges relevance and reliability using the criteria in IAS 8.

2.  **Impairment of Exploration and Evaluation Assets:**
    *   Exploration and evaluation assets must be assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. When facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an entity measures, presents and discloses any resulting impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
    *   IFRS 6 provides specific examples of facts and circumstances that indicate an entity should test exploration and evaluation assets for impairment. These include, but are not limited to: (a) the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed; (b) substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned; (c) exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; (d) sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
    *   An entity determines an accounting policy for allocating exploration and evaluation assets to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of assessing such assets for impairment. Each cash-generating unit or group of units to which an exploration and evaluation asset is allocated shall not be larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

3.  **Presentation and Classification:**
    *   Exploration and evaluation assets are classified as tangible or intangible according to the nature of the assets acquired and this classification should be applied consistently. For example, rights to explore are typically intangible, while drilling equipment would be tangible.

4.  **Disclosure:** IFRS 6 requires an entity to disclose information that identifies and explains the amounts recognised in its financial statements arising from the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources. This includes disclosing its accounting policies for exploration and evaluation expenditures, including the recognition of exploration and evaluation assets. An entity must also disclose the amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense, and operating and investing cash flows arising from the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources.

**Practical Example Scenario:**

OilSearch Co. is an entity engaged in exploring for oil. In 20X1, OilSearch Co. incurs $5 million in acquiring legal rights to explore a specific offshore block (Block Alpha). It also spends $10 million on geological and geophysical studies and $15 million on exploratory drilling in Block Alpha during the year. OilSearch Co.
's accounting policy is to capitalise all such direct exploration and evaluation expenditures as exploration and evaluation assets.

At the end of 20X1, OilSearch Co. would recognise exploration and evaluation assets of $30 million ($5m + $10m + $15m) related to Block Alpha. These would be classified as tangible or intangible based on their nature (e.g., the exploration rights as intangible, and any capitalised drilling costs that relate to physical assets as tangible, though often these are grouped as intangible exploration and evaluation assets).

During 20X2, initial drilling results from Block Alpha are disappointing and do not indicate commercially viable quantities of oil. Furthermore, global oil prices decline significantly, making the prospect of profitable extraction from Block Alpha unlikely even if some oil were found. Management of OilSearch Co. decides to halt further exploration in Block Alpha and does not budget any further expenditure for this block. These facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset for Block Alpha may be impaired.

OilSearch Co. would then test the $30 million asset for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. If the recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use) is determined to be, for example, only $2 million (perhaps representing the scrap value of some equipment or the potential sale value of the exploration data to another entity), OilSearch Co. would recognise an impairment loss of $28 million ($30 million - $2 million) in its profit or loss for 20X2. The carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset for Block Alpha would be written down to $2 million.

**Key Takeaways for IFRS 6:**

IFRS 6 provides specific, and somewhat lenient, guidance for accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditures, acknowledging the unique nature and risks associated with these activities in the extractive industries. It allows entities to continue with established accounting policies for these costs, provided they meet basic criteria, rather than forcing a single prescribed method. However, the standard is firm on the requirement to test exploration and evaluation assets for impairment when indicators suggest their carrying amount may not be recoverable, referencing IAS 36 for the impairment testing process. Disclosure of the accounting policies and the amounts involved is crucial for users to understand an entity's activities and investments in this high-risk, high-reward sector.
