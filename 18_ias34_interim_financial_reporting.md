## IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting is to prescribe the minimum content of an interim financial report and to prescribe the principles for recognition and measurement in complete or condensed financial statements for an interim period. Timely and reliable interim financial reporting improves the ability of investors, creditors, and others to understand an entity’s capacity to generate earnings and cash flows and its financial condition and liquidity.

**Scope:** IAS 34 does not mandate which entities should be required to publish interim financial reports, how frequently, or how soon after the end of an interim period. However, governments, securities regulators, stock exchanges, and accountancy bodies often require entities whose debt or equity securities are publicly traded to publish interim financial reports. This Standard applies if an entity is required or elects to publish an interim financial report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The International Accounting Standards Board encourages publicly traded entities to provide interim financial reports that conform to the recognition, measurement, and disclosure principles set out in this Standard. Specifically, publicly traded entities are encouraged: (a) to provide interim financial reports at least as of the end of the first half of their financial year; and (b) to make their interim financial reports available not later than 60 days after the end of the interim period.

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Interim period:** A financial reporting period shorter than a full financial year.
*   **Interim financial report:** A financial report containing either a complete set of financial statements (as described in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements) or a set of condensed financial statements (as described in this Standard) for an interim period.

**Content of an Interim Financial Report:**

IAS 34 states that an interim financial report shall include, at a minimum, the following components (condensed or complete):

1.  A condensed statement of financial position.
2.  A condensed statement or statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
3.  A condensed statement of changes in equity.
4.  A condensed statement of cash flows.
5.  Selected explanatory notes.

If an entity publishes a complete set of financial statements in its interim financial report, the form and content of those statements shall conform to the requirements of IAS 1 for a complete set of financial statements. If an entity publishes a set of condensed financial statements in its interim financial report, those condensed statements shall include, at a minimum, each of the headings and subtotals that were included in its most recent annual financial statements and the selected explanatory notes as required by this Standard. Additional line items or notes shall be included if their omission would make the condensed interim financial statements misleading.
Basic and diluted earnings per share shall be presented on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (or in the income statement, if presented separately), for an interim period.

**Selected Explanatory Notes:**
An entity shall include the following information, as a minimum, in the notes to its interim financial statements, if material and if not disclosed elsewhere in the interim financial report:
*   A statement that the same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in the interim financial statements as compared with the most recent annual financial statements or, if those policies or methods have been changed, a description of the nature and effect of the change.
*   Explanatory comments about the seasonality or cyclicality of interim operations.
*   The nature and amount of items affecting assets, liabilities, equity, net income, or cash flows that are unusual because of their nature, size, or incidence.
*   The nature and amount of changes in estimates of amounts reported in prior interim periods of the current financial year or changes in estimates of amounts reported in prior financial years.
*   Issuances, repurchases, and repayments of debt and equity securities.
*   Dividends paid (aggregate or per share) separately for ordinary shares and other shares.
*   Segment revenue and segment result for business segments or geographical segments, whichever is the entity’s primary basis of segment reporting (disclosure of segment information is required in an entity’s interim financial report only if IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires that entity to disclose segment information in its annual financial statements).
*   Material events subsequent to the end of the interim period that have not been reflected in the financial statements for the interim period.
*   The effect of changes in the composition of the entity during the interim period, including business combinations, acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and long-term investments, restructurings, and discontinued operations.
*   Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments.
*   For entities that become or cease to be investment entities, certain specific disclosures.

**Periods for which Interim Financial Statements are Required to be Presented:**
Interim reports shall include interim financial statements (condensed or complete) for periods as follows:
*   Statement of financial position as of the end of the current interim period and a comparative statement of financial position as of the end of the immediately preceding financial year.
*   Statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the current interim period and cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with comparative statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the comparable interim periods (current and year-to-date) of the immediately preceding financial year.
*   Statement of changes in equity cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with a comparative statement for the comparable year-to-date period of the immediately preceding financial year.
*   Statement of cash flows cumulatively for the current financial year to date, with a comparative statement for the comparable year-to-date period of the immediately preceding financial year.

**Recognition and Measurement Principles:**

*   **Same accounting policies as annual:** An entity shall apply the same accounting policies in its interim financial statements as are applied in its annual financial statements, except for accounting policy changes made after the date of the most recent annual financial statements that are to be reflected in the next annual financial statements. However, the frequency of an entity’s reporting (annual, half-yearly, or quarterly) shall not affect the measurement of its annual results. Therefore, measurements for interim reporting purposes shall be made on a year-to-date basis.
*   **Revenues received seasonally, cyclically, or occasionally:** Revenues that are received seasonally, cyclically, or occasionally within a financial year shall not be anticipated or deferred as of an interim date if anticipation or deferral would not be appropriate at the end of the entity’s financial year.
*   **Costs incurred unevenly during the financial year:** Costs that are incurred unevenly during an entity’s financial year shall be anticipated or deferred for interim reporting purposes if, and only if, it is also appropriate to anticipate or defer that type of cost at the end of the financial year.
*   **Use of estimates:** The measurement procedures to be followed in an interim financial report shall be designed to ensure that the resulting information is reliable and that all material financial information that is relevant to an understanding of the financial position or performance of the entity is appropriately disclosed. While measurements in both annual and interim financial reports are often based on reasonable estimates, the preparation of interim financial reports generally will require a greater use of estimation methods than annual financial reports.

**Restatement of Previously Reported Interim Periods:** A change in accounting policy, other than one for which the transition is specified by a new IFRS, shall be reflected by: (a) restating the financial statements of prior interim periods of the current financial year and the comparable interim periods of any prior financial years that will be restated in the annual financial statements in accordance with IAS 8; or (b) when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect at the beginning of the financial year of applying a new accounting policy to all prior periods, adjusting the financial statements of prior interim periods of the current financial year, and comparable interim periods of prior financial years to apply the new accounting policy prospectively from the earliest date practicable.

**Practical Example Scenario (Seasonal Revenue):**

A company sells ice cream, and its revenues are significantly higher in the summer months (Q2 and Q3) than in the winter months (Q1 and Q4). When preparing its Q1 interim financial report, the company should not anticipate the higher revenues expected in Q2 and Q3 by deferring some Q1 costs or accruing Q2/Q3 revenues in Q1. The revenues and expenses should be recognised as they occur in Q1, reflecting the seasonal nature of the business. The notes to the interim financial statements should explain the seasonality of its operations.

**Practical Example Scenario (Major Planned Maintenance Costs):**

A manufacturing company incurs significant planned maintenance costs on its machinery once a year, typically in Q4. If the company prepares quarterly interim reports, it should consider whether it is appropriate to accrue a portion of these maintenance costs in Q1, Q2, and Q3, or to recognise the full cost in Q4 when incurred. IAS 34 states that costs incurred unevenly shall be anticipated or deferred for interim reporting purposes if, and only if, it is also appropriate to anticipate or defer that type of cost at the end of the financial year. If the maintenance does not create an asset and is not a liability until performed, it would typically be expensed when incurred. However, if the entity’s policy for annual reporting is to accrue such costs over the year (e.g., if it relates to a consistent level of production benefit throughout the year and meets the definition of a liability), then a similar approach would be taken for interim periods.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 34:**

IAS 34 provides guidance for entities that prepare interim financial reports, focusing on the minimum content and the principles for recognition and measurement. It aims to ensure that interim reports provide timely and reliable information without imposing the full burden of annual reporting at each interim date. Key principles include using the same accounting policies as in the annual statements, making measurements on a year-to-date basis, and providing selected explanatory notes to highlight significant events and changes. While allowing for condensed statements, the standard emphasizes that the interim report should not be misleading and should enable users to understand the entity's performance and financial position during the interim period.
