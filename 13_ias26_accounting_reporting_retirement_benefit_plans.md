## IAS 26: Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans

**Objective:** The objective of IAS 26 Accounting and Reporting by Retirement Benefit Plans is to specify the measurement and disclosure principles for the reports of retirement benefit plans. Retirement benefit plans are arrangements, formal or informal, by which an entity provides benefits for its employees on or after termination of service (either in the form of an annual income or as a lump sum) when such benefits, or the contributions towards them, can be determined or estimated in advance of retirement from the provisions of a document or from the entity’s practices.

**Scope:** IAS 26 applies to the reports of retirement benefit plans. It deals with accounting and reporting by the plan to all participants as a group. It does not deal with reports to individual participants about their retirement benefit rights. This Standard complements IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which deals with the determination of the cost of retirement benefits in the financial statements of employers having plans. Therefore, this Standard deals with the accounting and reporting by the plan itself, whereas IAS 19 deals with the accounting by the employer for the costs of providing benefits.

IAS 26 distinguishes between two types of retirement benefit plans:

1.  **Defined contribution plans:** Plans under which amounts to be paid as retirement benefits are determined by contributions to a fund together with investment earnings thereon. The participants' benefits are determined by the contributions made by the employer (and sometimes the employee) and the investment performance of the fund.
2.  **Defined benefit plans:** Plans under which amounts to be paid as retirement benefits are determined by reference to a formula usually based on employees’ earnings and/or years of service. The employer effectively underwrites the actuarial and investment risks associated with the plan.

**Key Principles - Defined Contribution Plans:**

*   The report of a defined contribution plan shall contain a statement of net assets available for benefits and a description of the funding policy.
*   The objective of reporting by a defined contribution plan is to provide information periodically about the plan and the performance of its investments. That objective is usually achieved by providing a report including the following:
    *   A description of significant activities for the period and the effect of any changes relating to the plan, and its membership and terms and conditions.
    *   Statements reporting on the transactions and investment performance for the period and the financial position of the plan at the end of the period.
    *   A description of the investment policies.
*   Plan assets are usually carried at fair value. In the case of marketable securities, fair value is market value. Where plan investments are held for which an estimate of fair value is not possible, disclosure is made of the reason why fair value is not used.

**Key Principles - Defined Benefit Plans:**

*   The report of a defined benefit plan shall contain either:
    *   (a) a statement that shows the net assets available for benefits; the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, distinguishing between vested benefits and non-vested benefits; and the resulting excess or deficit; or
    *   (b) a statement of net assets available for benefits including either: (i) a note disclosing the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, distinguishing between vested benefits and non-vested benefits; or (ii) a reference to this information in an accompanying actuarial report.
*   If an actuarial valuation has not been prepared at the date of the report, the most recent valuation should be used as a base and the date of the valuation disclosed. The actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits should be based on the benefits promised under the terms of the plan on service rendered to date using either current salary levels or projected salary levels with disclosure of the basis used. The effect of any changes in actuarial assumptions that have had a significant effect on the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits should also be disclosed.
*   The report should explain the relationship between the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits and the net assets available for benefits, and the policy for the funding of promised benefits.
*   Similar to defined contribution plans, the objective of reporting by a defined benefit plan is to provide information periodically about the financial resources and activities of the plan that is useful in assessing the relationships between the accumulation of resources and plan benefits over time. This objective is usually achieved by providing a report including:
    *   A description of significant activities for the period and the effect of any changes relating to the plan, and its membership and terms and conditions.
    *   Statements reporting on the transactions and investment performance for the period and the financial position of the plan at the end of the period.
    *   Actuarial information either as part of the statements or by reference to an accompanying actuarial report.
    *   A description of the investment policies.
*   **Actuarial Present Value of Promised Retirement Benefits:** This is the present value of the expected payments by a retirement benefit plan to existing and past employees, attributable to the service already rendered. This is distinct from the defined benefit obligation (DBO) under IAS 19, which is measured from the perspective of the employer. IAS 26 focuses on the plan's perspective.
*   **Frequency of Actuarial Valuations:** The Standard does not specify the frequency with which actuarial valuations must be obtained. However, it suggests that such valuations should be obtained at least every three years, with more frequent valuations if conditions change significantly.

**All Plans (Both Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit):**

*   **Valuation of Plan Assets:** Retirement benefit plan investments shall be carried at fair value. For marketable securities, fair value is market value. Where plan investments are held for which an estimate of fair value is not possible, disclosure shall be made of the reason why fair value is not used.
*   **Disclosure:** The report of a retirement benefit plan, whether defined benefit or defined contribution, shall also contain the following information:
    *   A statement of changes in net assets available for benefits.
    *   A summary of significant accounting policies.
    *   Disclosure of the plan’s managers, trustees, and other administrators.
    *   Details of the investments held, often including an analysis by type of investment (e.g., equities, bonds, property) and sometimes geographic spread or concentration.
    *   For defined benefit plans, the actuarial assumptions used if the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits is disclosed in the financial statements.
    *   Any other information necessary to provide a clear understanding of the plan’s financial status and operations.

| **Total Liabilities**       | **(70,000)**| **(55,000)**|
| **Net Assets Available for Benefits** | **10,030,000**| **9,025,000**|

Accompanying notes would describe the funding policy (e.g., employer contributes X% of salary, employee contributes Y%), investment policies, and significant activities.

**Practical Example Scenario (Defined Benefit Plan Report Extract - Disclosing Actuarial Present Value in Notes):**

**ABC Corp Defined Benefit Pension Scheme**
**Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefits as at December 31, 20X1**

(Similar format to the defined contribution plan's statement of net assets)
Let's assume Net Assets Available for Benefits are $15,000,000.

**Note X: Actuarial Present Value of Promised Retirement Benefits**
As at December 31, 20X1, the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, based on an actuarial valuation performed by [Actuary Name] dated [Date], was as follows:
*   Vested benefits: $13,000,000
*   Non-vested benefits: $3,500,000
*   **Total Actuarial Present Value of Promised Retirement Benefits:** $16,500,000

**Funding Position:**
Net Assets Available for Benefits: $15,000,000
Actuarial Present Value of Promised Retirement Benefits: ($16,500,000)
Deficit: ($1,500,000)

The notes would also describe the funding policy, key actuarial assumptions (discount rate, salary escalation, etc.), and investment policies.

**Key Takeaways for IAS 26:**

IAS 26 focuses on the financial reporting *by* retirement benefit plans themselves, as separate reporting entities, rather than the accounting *by employers* for the costs of such benefits (which is IAS 19's domain). It aims to provide participants with information about the plan's resources, obligations (for defined benefit plans), and investment performance. Key requirements include valuing plan investments at fair value and, for defined benefit plans, disclosing the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits. The disclosures are tailored to help participants assess the plan's ability to meet its obligations.
